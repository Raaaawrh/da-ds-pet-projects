9,2024-07-02,1479.6,"This is one of the cases where I wish there was a ‚Äúmeh‚Äù option. This is a great battle royal game. The Legends system allows you to select characters with unique abilities, which adds depth to the game's combat. Each legend encourages a different playstyle and affects your team's dynamic. The issue arises when you look into actually playing the game. This is an EA game, after all. The game has a lot of yanks that you will become familiar with as you play. Sometimes you join a game and stutter and rubber band so much that the game is unplayable, and you have to leave the match or restart the game to fix it. I've also encountered that the match will randomly throw you out, and if you are really lucky, you will be able to join back. There are also regularly game-breaking exploits. Over the time I've played, I've seen the ability to damage opponents in peaceful zones, not being able to damage, not being able to pick up weapons, shooting through walls, not taking storm damage, camping areas with kill timers without dying, not being able to revive teammates, and much more. These bugs depend on updates and maps, usually. And what you will experience the most, and usually every session, is getting kicked, rubberbanding, lagging, and generally server issues. But the worst thing about the game has to be the players, especially your own teammates. If you play fills, you will experience teammates splitting up from the team, especially if they aren't jump masters and want to go to a different place and then proceed to get themselves killed and eventually leave. But teammates leaving as soon as they get knocked down is the most common thing you will experience. You will actually be surprised if a teammate doesn't leave instantly. You will also become familiar with the different types of players and the characters
they usually play. The characters I experienced to be the most toxic and lacking in Team Corporation are by far players like Wraith, Octane, and Pathfinder. You will very rarely have one that both knows how to cooperate and is non-toxic, but again, this is something that will be a surprising event. This is a game you will have a love-hate relationship with.",True

Unfortunately, a few things have ruined the game for me:

Aim Assist is too strong: According to R5, a modding and tracking community for the game, only 4 out of the top 1000 players are using mouse and keyboard. This reflects the in-game experience, where as a MnK player, you often get outperformed by most players. Controller players argue that MnK offers better movement, but statistics and the popularity of controllers clearly indicate an advantage for controllers.

The game is full of cheaters: A YouTuber named Zeus calculated the number of cheaters based on the number of players banned in ban waves. In ranked mode (the primary game mode), from gold rank and above, 1 out of 3 players you encounter is cheating with an aimbot or wallhack. Given that a squad consists of 3 players, you will almost always encounter a cheater.

Security issues in tournaments: Recently, hackers managed to manipulate servers and even injected cheats into pro players' accounts. Videos documenting these incidents can be found on YouTube. The server security is not 100% guaranteed.

Trust me when I say, it's not worth picking up this game until EA fixes the aim assist and the cheating problems. It‚Äôs not fun, it will make you angry, and you won't enjoy playing it.",False

With any multiplayer game it does have some issues with balancing characters but for the most part the devs keep it mostly under control (This is only my personal experience). While playing with friends is the best way to go, I have enjoyed plenty of solo sessions as well. At the end of the day this is a battle royal through and through, so from its core there is nothing super unique about the game from that aspect.

There really isn't a shooter out there quite like this one. I have tried them all. Yes, I know....we have Titanfall and yes...I go back and play on it from now and again. I just really love the ""hero"" part of Apex and the complexity of how a game pans out differently quite often.

I really want to encourage new players to play.

I enjoy it sometimes....often times the people who take it too serious (Controller Zen/XIM) ESP, Radar, aimbotters) literally ruin this game for those who are legit competitors. I am nearing the end of my time on FPS I believe. The cheaters have ruined it for everyone. Thanks a lot to you guys. Well done. Hats off and enjoy your digital banner that means literally nothing in the real world. I hate that I have to take away the multiplayer aspect of playing with the homies because cheating is rampant in any competitive fps.

872,2024-06-25,3.2,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Apex Legends, where the only thing hotter than the dropship's engines are the fiery emotions you'll experience. Consider this your content warning: This game may cause spontaneous outbursts of joy, frustration-induced laughter, and an insatiable urge to shout ""Bamboozled!"" at the top of your lungs.

Let's start with the adrenaline rush, because Apex Legends hits harder than a Gibraltar ult. From the moment you drop into the map like a caffeinated superhero, every second is a rollercoaster of emotions. One minute you're looting like a pro, the next you're getting third-partied faster than you can say ""respawn beacon.""

And speaking of legends, let's talk about the characters. They're more diverse than a buffet at a food festival, each with their own quirks and abilities. Whether you're ziplining with Pathfinder or setting traps with Caustic, there's a legend for every playstyle and a personality to match. And don't even get me started on Mirage ‚Äì the guy's ego is bigger than the loot vaults on Olympus.

Now, let's address the weapons. They're the real stars of the show, turning every firefight into a symphony of chaos and carnage. From snipers that hit like a meteor to shotguns that make enemies regret ever leaving their hiding spots, choosing your loadout is like picking your favorite flavor of mayhem.

But it's not all sunshine and respawn beacons in Apex Legends. Let's talk about the moments that make you question your life choices ‚Äì like falling off a cliff because you got too cocky with Octane's jump pad, or realizing too late that your teammate's idea of strategy is throwing grenades at their own feet.

And let's not forget the ping system ‚Äì a masterpiece of communication that allows you to scream ""enemy here!"" without actually screaming. It's the lifeline that keeps squads together, even when you're spread out across the map like a disorganized game of hide-and-seek.

In conclusion, Apex Legends is a whirlwind romance with chaos, where every match is a chance to prove your skills and test your sanity. Approach with caution, embrace the highs and lows, and remember: Even when the loot gods are against you, there's always another dropship waiting. Final rating: 8 out of 10, because in the world of Apex Legends, the only thing predictable is the unpredictable.",True

The legends in this game are as diverse as your sock collection - some are super cool, some are a bit quirky, and some will make you question your life choices. But that's the beauty of it! Where else can you see a robot, a soldier, and a ninja fight side by side for that sweet, sweet victory?

The loot system is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're gonna get. Will it be a shiny new weapon or a Mozambique that's just waiting to disappoint you? Embrace the randomness, my friends, and learn to love the loot, no matter how trollish it may be.

Apex Legends is not just a game; it's a wild, unpredictable adventure that will have you laughing, crying, and screaming into your mic in equal measure.

These systems match players against opponents of varying skill levels to stimulate prolonged play through psychological triggers, which is a well-documented phenomenon. Furthermore, they can pair players with skilled teammates who have purchased cosmetic items (skins) to create a false sense of improvement, potentially leading to more micro-transaction sales. They may even adjust matchmaking after purchase to maintain your interest. In essence, SBMM and EOMM are tools to maximize developer profits, where the game 'plays' the player.",False

Femboys are often celebrated for breaking traditional gender norms and expanding the spectrum of expression and identity. Here are a few reasons why they are often seen in such a positive light:

Celebration of Diversity: Femboys challenge societal expectations by blending masculine and feminine traits, showcasing the beauty of gender diversity and fluidity.

Fashion and Style: Their fashion sense often combines elements from both genders, creating unique and striking outfits that inspire creativity and personal expression.

Breaking Stereotypes: By embracing their femininity while identifying as male, femboys challenge stereotypes about what it means to be masculine, promoting a more inclusive understanding of gender roles.

Supporting Self-Expression: Their visibility encourages others to express themselves authentically, whether through fashion choices, hobbies, or personality traits that may not conform to traditional gender norms.

Community and Acceptance: Many femboys find community and acceptance among peers who value individuality and diversity, fostering supportive environments for personal growth and exploration.

Cultural Impact: Through social media and other platforms, femboys have gained visibility and influence, contributing to broader discussions about gender identity, acceptance, and representation.

Ultimately, the appreciation for femboys stems from their courage to be true to themselves, challenge stereotypes, and contribute to a more inclusive and understanding society. They remind us that gender expression is personal and multifaceted, and that diversity should be celebrated rather than suppressed.Femboys are often celebrated for breaking traditional gender norms and expanding the spectrum of expression and identity.

Ingredients
1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter
1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/3 cup (40g) unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 cup (65g) all-purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking powder

Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C). Grease an 8x8-inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper.
2. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Remove from heat and stir in sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract.
3. Add the dry ingredients: Stir in cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder until the batter is well combined.
4. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly.
5. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the brownies begin to pull away from the sides of the pan and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.

I joined one match where 2 French players join to troll and insult me with their microphones on ofc.

If someone does everything to make you angry ,its reasonable that human will react like this ,since we are not robots.

I hope this game get shut down, since we have 0 protection from harmful trolls and cheaters in this game.

Funny thing one friend told me ''If you insulted them back in voice ,nothing would happen''

So I guess all people need to do is use mic to abuse someone and get with it.
While game company expect us to be silent like robots while someone insult and abuse us for their amusement.

Btw I think I even won that game or finish 2nd.

1. Make account Steam or Origin
2. Login
3. Klik play (dont forget invite or wait ur friend to join, u doesnt want to lose ur rank solo)
4. Find place to land (note: more attractive that place for enemy and as a soon u jump from dropship and as soon u get back to lobby more fun game will be)
5. Looting (this important thing, even ur friend fight keep looting, more loot u bring for ur enemy more good person u are)
6. and then find enemy (more chaos more fast we get down our rank)
7. Rush, forget to use ur skill its not important, and most important think blame how ur friend use they skill
8. Die
9. Blame ur friend (u should does it, game would not fun if u dont do it)
10. Back to lobby, and u talk ur last game, how bad ur condition at on last fight
11. Loop that method, as long as you can, play every night with your friends
12. You end up will get mentality broken soon, and feel numb playing game again its good for ur future (absolutely +1000% from PEPE coin)

13. After 1000 hours gameplay never try another movement, but blame ur friend movement, keep strolling its best movement in apex legend
14. Dont forget to setting the mouse dpi as low as possible, its make ur aim more good, cause its doesnt look like using controller, when u set it to high is seem like u using controller and blame again

15. Dont forget to ignore all my advice, and have fun ""GAME SHOULD MADE TO BE FUN""

1687,2024-06-17,123.2,"Apex Legends: A Rollercoaster of Fun with Some Bumps

Apex Legends burst onto the battle royale scene with a bang, offering intense squad-based gameplay and a refreshing take on the genre. From the get-go, the game's fast-paced action and unique character abilities made it a standout choice for gamers seeking a break from the more traditional battle royale experiences.

The game was super fun right from the start. The thrill of dropping into Kings Canyon or World's Edge with a squad of diverse legends, each with their own abilities, added layers of strategy and excitement. Whether you were coordinating with teammates to secure a coveted drop zone or clutching a victory in the final firefight, every match brought its own adrenaline rush.

However, not all was perfect in the Apex Games. The removal of the Arena mode, which offered a more condensed and tactical experience, was a sore point for many players, including myself. The decision to streamline the game to focus solely on battle royale matches left a gap for those who enjoyed quicker, more intimate skirmishes. This change contributed to the feeling that the game got old fast and became repetitive over time.

Moreover, while Apex Legends introduced innovative mechanics like sliding and character-specific ultimates, some aspects of the game's mechanics felt clunky or unrefined. Hit registration issues and inconsistent server performance occasionally marred otherwise thrilling gameplay sessions, leading to frustrating moments that detracted from the overall experience.

Despite these drawbacks, Apex Legends continues to evolve. New legends, weapons, and map updates keep the game fresh, and the community remains engaged with regular events and challenges. The developers' commitment to listening to player feedback and implementing changes has been commendable, ensuring that Apex Legends retains its place as a top contender in the battle royale genre.

In conclusion, Apex Legends is undeniably a super fun game with its high-energy battles and unique character-driven gameplay. However, the removal of Arena mode, coupled with the game's tendency to feel repetitive, and occasional mechanical issues, prevents it from achieving true greatness. Nonetheless, for players seeking a fast-paced battle royale experience with a wealth of tactical options, Apex Legends remains a solid choice despite its flaws.",False

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | A Solid Battle Royale with Exciting Gameplay, but Room for Improvement

Apex Legends, developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts, burst onto the battle royale scene in 2019 with its unique blend of fast-paced action, character abilities, and team-based gameplay. While the game offers an exciting and fresh take on the genre, it also faces challenges that affect its overall experience. Here‚Äôs a look at the strengths and weaknesses of Apex Legends:

Pros:

1. Dynamic and Fast-Paced Gameplay:
One of the standout features of Apex Legends is its dynamic and fast-paced gameplay. The movement mechanics, including sliding, climbing, and zip-lining, offer a fluid and exhilarating experience that sets it apart from other battle royale games. The game‚Äôs focus on mobility and quick engagements makes each match feel action-packed and engaging, catering to players who enjoy a more aggressive and fast-moving style of play.

2. Unique and Diverse Legends:
The game features a roster of diverse characters known as Legends, each with unique abilities and playstyles. This variety allows players to choose a Legend that suits their preferred approach, whether it‚Äôs aggressive combat, support, or strategic play. The abilities add an extra layer of strategy and teamwork, encouraging players to coordinate and leverage their Legends‚Äô strengths effectively.

3. Team-Based Focus and Communication:
Apex Legends emphasizes team-based gameplay, with squads of three working together to secure victory.* The game‚Äôs innovative ping system allows for intuitive and effective communication, even without voice chat. Players can mark enemies, loot, and locations, making it easier to coordinate and plan strategies. This focus on teamwork fosters a sense of camaraderie and collaboration, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

4. High-Quality Graphics and Audio:
The game boasts high-quality graphics and audio design, providing an immersive and visually appealing experience. The detailed environments, vibrant colors, and smooth animations contribute to the game‚Äôs aesthetic appeal. The sound design, including weapon effects and character voice lines, adds depth and immersion, helping players stay aware of their surroundings and engage more effectively in combat.

Cons:

1. Limited Map Variety and Repetitive Gameplay:
Despite its engaging mechanics, Apex Legends can suffer from a lack of map variety and repetitive gameplay. While the available maps are well-designed and offer diverse environments, the game would benefit from more frequent updates and new locations to keep the experience fresh. Over time, the repetition of the same maps and gameplay loop can lead to a sense of monotony for long-term players.

2. Inconsistent Matchmaking and Balancing:
Matchmaking and balancing issues can impact the overall enjoyment of Apex Legends. Players may encounter matches with uneven skill levels, leading to frustrating experiences where beginners face off against highly skilled opponents. Additionally, the balancing of Legends and weapons can sometimes feel inconsistent, with certain characters or loadouts dominating the meta and limiting strategic diversity.

3. Progression System and Monetization Concerns:
The game‚Äôs progression system and monetization model have drawn criticism from some players. While Apex Legends is free-to-play, its in-game currency and loot box system can feel overly reliant on microtransactions. The grind for cosmetics and Legend unlocks may seem excessive to those unwilling to spend money, potentially impacting the sense of reward and progression.

4. Occasional Technical Issues:
Technical issues, including server instability and occasional bugs, can detract from the overall experience. Players may encounter lag, connection drops, or other performance problems, especially during peak times or major updates. These issues can disrupt gameplay and lead to frustration, particularly in a game where split-second decisions and smooth performance are crucial.

Conclusion:
Apex Legends offers an exciting and innovative take on the battle royale genre, with dynamic gameplay, unique characters, and a strong focus on team-based action. However, the game also faces challenges with limited map variety, balancing issues, and a monetization model that may not appeal to everyone. While Apex Legends provides a solid and enjoyable experience for fans of fast-paced shooters, it has room for improvement to enhance its long-term appeal and address the concerns of its player base.

If you‚Äôre looking for a fresh and fast-paced battle royale with a focus on teamwork and character abilities, Apex Legends delivers a solid experience that‚Äôs worth trying. Enjoy the thrill of fluid movement, diverse Legends, and engaging combat, but be prepared for some areas where the game could still grow and evolve.",True

2009,2024-06-13,637.8,"I really love to hop on and play some apex, as I have a decent amount of time in it. But, the current state of the game is rough to just hop on and have a casual experience. I typically play ranked and across all levels it's filled with nothing but absolute sweats who tryhard on everything. The ranking system goes as rookie, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, masters and apex predator. I've always gotten around the high silver to mid gold level. It seems the only people that are around the rank I am at are the people that are in the high ranks but are quickly making their way through the lower ranks. So all my teammates are in diamond/masters and shouldn't be in my silver/gold lobbies. They are leagues better than me and expect me to perform at their level but I've never and will never be that high in rank. If you miss a single shot and don't instantly get the knock you get yelled at by teammates for being absolute trash and an awful teammate. I would hop into trios, which isn't ranked, but about every other game I have someone who leaves early game because they got knocked. Not even killed yet but just instantly leave the moment they get downed and I can revive them back up. I'm glad they added solos in the game for season 21 so it gives all those people a playlist to be instead of just dropping on a random part of the map with abandoning your two other teammates.

The core gameplay of the game is really fun. It's always felt nice to drop in and grab gear. To level up your shield and get new abilities and I think it's a good update for the game. But, another thing is movement in the game. If you don't master the movement techs out there people will still call you trash and an awful teammate. ""bro why didn't you superglide into a tapstrafe to hit the wall bounce?? Don't get in my party again asswipe"" is sometimes what I hear and it's rough. I had someone leave my discord call, unfriend me AND block me because I didn't perform well in a duo game. Not even ranked and it was just a casual duo game. That's your average teammate at this point. I used to have friends who played this game but they all have dropped out because of how toxic and sweaty every game is. Which I completely understand. You have to be perfect with everything or else you just get bodied. So now I'm the only one left in the friend group so I have to resort to randoms and hope they are relatively chill people. At this point I almost don't even use voicechat because I'm constantly getting barraged with over the top callouts and then getting yelled at for not hitting 100% of my shots.

Overall I will always love apex for it's gameplay and movement. It's just the random teammates I get is what ruins the game for me. I'm not the best at movement but I learn just enough to have some basic fun with it. Nothing too crazy. I just can't play the game in long sessions anymore because of the constant toxic random people I get. All the casuals have left the game and the only players left are the really really good ones who play this game 10 hours a day and make it their damn full time job. If you don't have 20 kill badge, 4k badge and 5000 kills with your character then you're considered a pleb and unwanted by any teammates. Not sure if they can ever fix the issue of horrible bm that comes with players as that's not the games fault and it's just the natural state of the game by it's players. I would like to leave this as a positive review but the whole point of a game is to play it and have fun. I no longer have a lot of fun playing this game with it's current state. I just hop on for an hour once a week to get that crave of what Apex used to be. I'm mid af at the game and will always be. Some people just can't seem to grasp that everyone isn't top 500 in their region. I never write reviews for games but I just have a lot to say about this game. It used to be a fun game to casually hop on with friends. Now it's a sea of nothing but top tier players and makes it damn near impossible for a new player to start.

This game has been a great game during ss13 to ss16. If time could be manipulated and you could us some way to travel back to ss13, I would highly recommend this game. After ss17 when the game changed its rank system, things began falling apart. The culture of ""hide and seek"" appeared in the community, Masters became a joke, hackers and DMA user ratio increased rapidly, and Respawn continuously F**K's up the rank system as the season proceeds to ss21.

Season 20 was fine at the beginning. Returning the ranking system back to the old days and adding the flatline event revived the game from the ICU for only half a season. Cheaters increased by tens of thousands straight after the first half of ss20, Heirloom events are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, and the Anti-cheat update banned accounts of loyal normal players who kept on playing in this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• environment, trying their best to enjoyed the game. This game is now total ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.

Disappointing Performance in Apex Legends

Apex Legends has been a highly anticipated game for many, but unfortunately, it hasn't lived up to expectations for me due to severe performance issues.

Game Doesn't Run Smoothly

From the moment I launched the game, I experienced significant lag and stuttering. Despite having a system that meets the recommended requirements, Apex Legends runs poorly, with frequent frame rate drops and occasional freezes. This makes it incredibly difficult to enjoy the fast-paced action the game promises.

Unoptimized Experience

It's clear that Apex Legends is not well-optimized. The game's graphics and effects, while impressive, seem to come at the cost of performance stability. Even on lower settings, the game struggles to maintain a consistent frame rate. This lack of optimization is frustrating and takes away from the overall gaming experience.

Final Thoughts

While Apex Legends has potential with its unique gameplay and mechanics, the current state of the game is disappointing due to its poor performance. Until these issues are addressed and the game is properly optimized, I cannot recommend it.

2289,2024-06-10,1619.3,"As of season 21 I cannot recomend this game for anyone, either a casual player who jumps in for a few games a week to have fun or somebody who playes ranked. I'll list all the pros and cons of this gameand will rank them form the most important to less.
CONS:
20 tick servers - havent played from day 1 but still played this game a lot, 1600h is I think enough to say some things but from the moment I played ive got too much situations where Im behind cover and the enemy kills me or the other way around, mobile games have that kind of servers, but a multi bilion dollar game to have servers worse even than R6 - a game released in 2015, personaly I dont think the hardware is that expensive to upgrade for one of the biggest games, idk how ""pros"" play this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on turnaments but it's unbereable.

Ranked - Im not that good, just avrage but for me to grind 100h twice so 200h (or more) just to get a charm a badge and or a FRAME that will dissapear in 1 or 2 seasons, not worth it, the sbmm and other matchmaking systems are tragic for a RANKED system, making it to a level 20 is easy so you can get many smurfs in low lobbies just for them to ""have fun"" killing noobs, reported many of them, I don't think there should be that much of them. The system literary punishes you if you get high kill game on ranked and just want to get aout of the rank fast. Devs can't decide how to make it good and it changes every season so you have to get used to it every 3 moths. The split is unnecesary and just adds to grind.

Matchmaking and SBMM - either nonexistent or so tight that it's unbereable, the game mostly pairs you with players who have many times more kills and than youre whole account on one legend, ranks way higher than you and above all, skill level so high that you can just stand and loose the match becaouse if he just sees you then you are dead. A new player who can shoot somewhat good from other games but with no knowlege of the game (healing system, rotations, red weapon system etc) can be put against a player who knows every line of code of the game so the first few games are on bots and the rest of the account games are hell.

Antycheat or rather it's nonexistence, I dont think there were any bans which where not manual made by a human, the game has cheaters and smurfs (Respawn, if you give an option for reporting smurfs than why not use it?) nowdays it's easier to reoprt someone for swearing on vc or text to get them banned then for accual aimbot or wh hacks. there are easy solutions for all of them but nothing is being done.

Devs listening to pros which make not even 5% of the player base rather than the whole community. It's all becaouse o money, the pros can just cry someone is weak and puf , devs bufgf that legend, or the RARE weapon, max 2 on the whole match is too op so let's just nerf it and now the common weapon is just as powerfull as the rare so why pick rare whith limitted ammo. But if the community wants to have anything, them so begins the russina roulette if devs will even CONSIDER doing it.

these were the major problems with the game and these are the main argument to not play it
here will be the less important

devs not staying true to their words
fixing the shop faster than you can blink but bugs are present for the whole season or 2 to 3 weeks (just google how big of a problem scripts were in s20 or s19 for the whole season [remember respawn, these playters should be banned for usinmg 3rd party software and exploiting the game but then wayyy too many pro players and top ranked platyers would be banned)
the costs and quality of the skins (mainly legendaries) [heirlooms are overpriced as hell plz dont buy them]
little to no communication with the devs or anyone from them
aim assist too strong, mnk players are now a minority for that reason (I don't think there is any other game with stats like that) this can be fixed easly, give the game a lot more movement and don't limit it, if roller have aa then give mnk players movement (it doesn't have to be easy to learn but not almost impossible like mantle jump or super glide with a window of 2 frames to make it)
LIMITING MOVEMENT - somethng that got me in his game, thre was a lot of movement, could do a lot of things to win fights or run away but there is a steady decline in techs that a cassual player could do so for me this game alomst lost it's charm.
Limited time skins never returning are returning, thats not okey
Audio? - can be a problem but can be fixed, can get used to it
more pay events than accual noew modes and old events returning
the mixtape - a gamemode with 4 modes rotating, it's nice bt the matchmaking makes it 50% of time not enjoyable with players who has much more skill than you.
reskins a cheap way to make money i guess
skill level entry is quite high but can be fixed with good matchmaking
taking too much content and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• from Titanfall 2 - aither you make TF 3 or just leave TF 2 alone, this game could be in some other unverse and still could have a good story

THE PROS
the movement - limites but still gives a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ton of fun
everything is balanced in a good way, some legends and weapons are stronger than the others but the other can be used too, they need just a bit more skill
the maps - nice design and originality
most event are really good, but can be even better
just originaliy i guess

Summary - so just as you read all of this if you accualty read all of that then Im suprised) there are many, many many cons for this game and not a lot of pros to counter that, the biggest problem is that the devs will not fix any o that if the community doesn't stop fueling (buying overpriced skins) and just riots for 1 or 2 seasons, don't play and don't do anything, only then the major problems will be adressed and will then the game be worth the time and effort to play. As some games either don;t have the potential or are dead (battlefront 2, palladins) that this game has the potential both for casual and pro scene that right now it's just neglected by both the devs and EA just sucking the money and adding no content or just 305 of what this game could be.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",True

I would say this is a great game for anyone who has some friends they want to play a fun little shooter with, or even anyone who wants to get sweaty and play super competitively it has options for everyone. There is an anti cheat system in play However, I do still encounter a fair bit of people with very questionable aim/movement that when spectated are almost certainly cheating.

2449,2024-06-08,1245.2,"As a consumer, the game feels severely busted and in mad frustrating probably 75% of the time. The audio issues, the fair matchmaking issues, the balancing, the nerfing--it's all pretty annoying, especially because Respawn seems to cater to the pros (from my experience, being someone who keeps up with the esport) and nerfs legends/guns based on the pro scene and what is in meta. Feels like they're consistently ""fixing"" random things, which leads to more random bugs (Ex. Revenant reborn's broken af, OP af debut. My god. That was so miserable. Bro was immune to dying that split)

- Forced input cross-play on PC is annoying. I'd like to play with other MnK players (even tho we are a dying breed), but I don't think this'll ever happen considering most ppl play on roller these days, from what I understand.

- AA makes some switch to roller. Don't think it's necessary to do that, but it's frustrating that players feel like they have to switch in order to feel like they can just play pubs lol the pro scene is flooded with rollers now, too, so that definitely influences the AA linear lifestyle

- Matchmaking is WHACK. Most common badges I see these days are masters/pred badges, coupled with either one 20-bomb and the 4k badge, or two 20-bomb badges. Those badges are EVERYWHERE. They're supposed to be amongst the hardest badges to get, but they're literally EVERYWHERE. Can't remember the last time I saw a normie gold or plat badge

- THE CHEATERS BRO. WHAT THE HELL. 30% OF MASTERS/PREDS WERE BANNED BC THEY WERE CHEATING. Bros get to level 500+ and then MAYBE get caught?? How is easy anti-cheat that easy to cheat?? I'm so confused!! I'm so tired!!

Anyway TL;DR I'm stuck in a toxic relationship with this game and even though it has charming legends and fun mechanics, other stuff out of my control gets in the way and makes the game less fun, whether it be weak servers, cheaters, bad matchmaking, weird bugs, etc. I'm 1.2k hrs deep, so I'll probably keep going as F2P, but I wouldn't recommend this to new players unless you're already a BR-enjoyer and/or enjoy a soulsborne-flavoured, curb-stomping, grind experience that will probably make you rage until you pull off one cool clutch and get a good spike of dopamine to keep you hooked",False

Streamers are the only ones who are listened to when it comes to changes and adjustments towards balancing issues, legend balancing, SBMM and ranked. Of course the company would listen to them, but what about the majority of its player base? No i'm not your ""Casual"" player, i have been invested in this game since season 4 and have played it off and on, i'm a hard stuck diamond since i only solo cue and half my teammates have no game sense. Back on topic with the issues that still persist,

1. The audio is trash with all the noise clutter, you can hear fighting from across the map and lava bubbling but as soon as someone is right behind me licking my taint they just catch me off guard and its a rinse and repeat cycle of how i end up back in the lobby.

2. The servers are GARBAGE, i pay for half a gig internet speed but i'm always having server issues on the west coast, they literally run off a toaster connected to a lemon which is then powdered by a hamster whose dead body momentum is keeping the wheel turning.

But instead of addressing the issues they decide to come out with more ""mythics"" which already have a stupid low drop chance unless you pay around $200 for one of the events. And get this, they re-colored the mythics for certain characters but if you already OWN one you have to wait until you get the shards for the different color variant... Like why? If i already own the base model how come i cant just spend credits or crafting shards for the different color? Maybe a level grind to unlock it so i actually have something to look forward to and keep me engaged in this god awful game. Some mythic skins have dive trials and others don't, Its a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• show of a concept. But yet i keep coming back because the sound of cracking someone tickles my pea sized brain. Its a love hate relationship that later on turns abusive. Do what you will with this information, but the frustration is real.

3. SBMM/Ranked. I don't even know where to start with the ranked scene, half the people who solo queue just decided to rush into ranked and not take the time to understand movement, positional advantages, AIMING AND HITTING YOUR SHOTS FOR GOD SAKE and how each legend works. What really adds icing onto the cake is while you are having to tolerate your teammates you're also put against a 3 stack pred team. Like why? Why do i have a silver and gold on my team while having to deal with preds in a platinum lobby.

Also stop coming out with event skins that players can buy at a reduced price, I thought the events were supposed event oriented not rewash material. Fix your game EA or at least come out with titanfall 3. Either way it would probably be another title you kill completely.",False

Gameplay and Mechanics
Apex Legends is undeniably a fantastic game. Its fast-paced, team-based battle royale format keeps the adrenaline pumping from the moment you drop onto the map. The unique abilities of each Legend add a layer of strategy and depth, making every match dynamic and exciting. The graphics are stunning, and the game runs smoothly, offering a highly immersive experience.

Community Feedback and Developer Response
However, despite the excellent gameplay, the way the developers handle community feedback is a major downside. Players have voiced numerous concerns and suggestions over the years, but it often feels like these fall on deaf ears. The lack of responsiveness to community desires can be frustrating, as many feel that the game could be significantly improved if the developers listened more to player feedback.

Cheating and Matchmaking Issues
Cheating is another significant issue that detracts from the overall experience. While it's common to encounter exceptionally skilled players, there are times when it‚Äôs clear that cheaters are ruining the game. The current anti-cheat measures are inadequate, and this ongoing problem severely impacts the enjoyment and fairness of the game.

Matchmaking, especially in ranked play, is also problematic. Being placed in matches with players of vastly different skill levels, such as queuing as a Gold rank and being paired with a Diamond player, creates a huge imbalance. This can be disheartening and frustrating, as it often leads to matches that feel unwinnable and unfair.

Conclusion
In summary, Apex Legends is a great game with exciting mechanics and engaging gameplay. However, it is let down by poor management, inadequate response to community feedback, and persistent issues with cheating and matchmaking. The developers need to address these problems to enhance the player experience and maintain the game's long-term appeal. If they can fix the anti-cheat system and improve matchmaking, Apex Legends has the potential to be one of the best games in its genre. For now, it's a good game that‚Äôs unfortunately held back by some significant flaws.",True

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",True

this game was a gem years ago, seasons 1-6 were honestly a blast, game felt refreshing and there was a larger player base so you weren't put up with people on the top if you weren't on the top

It started going downhill on season 7, The content was great, sure, but the player base started to dwindle.
Somewhere around season 11-12, things hit the fan and you started seeing 3 stack predators in *Normal Lobbies*. i think this was something they did with ranked.
it hasn't really recovered, the game has gotten stale, respawn is a shell of what it used to be.

If your looking for a shooter, I reckon to say that this isn't a good place to start.
I have tried multiple times to get back into this game following season 12, but to no avail. Each session was just met with more and more frustration as me and my friends (arguably middle golds) were consistently matched against high diamonds, masters, and the occasional predators, in both ranked and unranked.
""Skill based matchmaking"" is no longer a solid thing, I'm afraid. and you cant improve if you get gunned down the moment somebody sees you.

That, and EA/Respawn have been shifting more and more away from ""interesting gameplay"" and more and more into ""recycled content to sell more skins"" Ontop of butchering existing and established ideas to be ""politically correct""

In this game you can win 10 out of 10 placement matches... and even though lets say you were diamond the previous season... this dumb ass game will put your ass in SILVER... It is designed not to put you in your correct rank division but rather to force the player-base to grind in order to keep players busy chasing something they already achieved.. By the way the game only gives you 3 months to rank up.. ( it used to be 1.5 months LMAO). By the time you climb back to your previous season peak, you will only have a couple weeks to try and reach past it... truly a flawed pathetic rank system and schedule. For comparison- I just finished this seasons placement matches in League of Legends. Last season I ended at platinum 2. After my 5 placement games, league put me back at platinum 3. The contrast is insane. Also- after not playing this game like four-six months it will degrade you down to ROOKIE... this game is a joke.

It has just become a typical cash and grab scam now having you pay tons of money just to get into lobbies where your bodied constantly going from dropping solos with Crypto having 19 to 20 kills per match and getting champion to this garbage.

I can't think of a worse Battle Royal at the moment...maybe Paladins?? Anyway I do not recommend this game at all the Devs are very out of touch and clearly don't care about the quality of their game anymore.

most liked
The variety of characters & weaponry that can offer a wide array of play styles.
Ease of being able to jump in and out of matches for some quick play.
Don't have to pay to win. you can buy or earn characters and can support respawn if you want with accessories/gift/skin/ season purchases.

Disliked - Cross platform with ps5 to PC level scaling.
Context: my brother plays more on ps5 and he'll have a higher rank generally than me so If we both play on a ps5 we play an evenly matched players still, however, if we play where I'm on PC, it still scales to my brother's rank stil but instead of a mix of ps5/pc players - its mostly PC players making for a much much much harder state of play. We've tried this multiple times to see if we just had off games, but we're convinced we have a much more competitive matches when we are not on the same system. It's a small thing that may not effect most but lets just say there is a reason why matches scale players and sometimes we want a good matches rather than getting humbled all night haha so if you don't want to run with the big dogs maybe be careful with your crossplay options",True

3049,2024-06-02,999.9,"At the time of this review, I played the game on pc for 999.9 hours, and on console for ~2000 hours. Here's what I can conclude (I took a long hiatus from the game to focus on school, so I cannot speak on the current state of Apex and will write this based on my memory of previous seasons).

Pros: Great gunplay/gun mechanics, slow time-to-kill which allows for long and entertaining fights compared to other battle royale games, solid and rewarding movement mechanics, and a variety of ways to keep the game fresh (limited-time gamemodes, a rotating battle-royale map selection, and mixtape maps like deathmatch, gun game, etc.).

Cons: Steep learning curve for new players (many characters to learn with learning curves on each individual character, variety of maps to learn and understand, movement mechanics, like superglides, that take time to learn and perfect), broken SBMM at times (especially when party members have a significantly lower MMR than you do). In order to improve and progress in the game, a significant time commitment is required overall. Despite this, casual players who do not want to commit to this can find the overall experience enjoyable.

The game suffers from issues that are to be expected with shooter games like it, like the occasional broken meta or legend and third, fourth, and sometimes fifth-partying as a result of the slow time-to-kill, for example. However, these factors should not deter new players from giving Apex a fair shot, as the game is great overall when one looks past these issues.",True

What can I say, I just deleted my fav game. Impossible to have fun when cheaters spray your head from the distance, find you on hidden corners, and have perfect recoil. It should be fairly obvious for the publisher to figure who's cheating (e.g., players killing with 100% accuracy, short range weapons killing form distance, fast kill to next rates, etc).

But, because one cannot be entirely sure of the method, ""sandwiches"" qua sandwiches are notoriously susceptible to being misinterpreted. The mere act of observance may change the observer.

So, strictly speaking, Pop Tarts are stuffed like ravioli. Or are they layered and sides crimped? Are tacos layered or stuffed? How about lettuce wraps at that ""Chinese"" food place with the big horse outside it over at the mall?

While scholars may debate this, your Redditor here (n.b. there is no flair for ""gassbag"") is a strict constuctionist. The layering, viz., stratification must be in seriatim. One layer *then another layer.

So ""stuffed"" items, with a ""filling,"" are not, strictly speaking, stratified. But scholars less orthodox than I may disagree, although I deem them unworthy of academic respect in this regard.

It matters not the number of substrate moieties upon which the layering is done, nor the composition of said substrate. Bread, lettuce, fried chicken, potato chips. Double decker, triple decker, a plurality if deckers, turtles all the way down. Layered with a viscous spread like honey. (Bonus- honey is the second sweetest thing in the world. The first sweetest is YOU.) Or peanut butter or Vegemite or mayo or chopped liver. Perhaps a solid strata, like ham. Or a friable strata, like tuna salad. The list is endless, figuratively, although perhaps literally as anything can be a comestible if you try hard enough.

The critical feature is that there is something laid upon said substrate that does not intermix with the substrate. So a layer cake with frosting spread in between is not a sandwich, because the frosting/cake layers are integral. That is, one cannot (practically) remove one moiety from another without destroying the whole. (There are those willing to lick off the frosting to remove it there by leaving pure substrate, nevertheless they will leave fur or whiskers from time to time there changing the nature of the melange.)

One may conger a maternal figure lovingly making such sandwich, whereas, in truth, it may be the black heart of a soul- less machine. One may eat a sandwich to remember, or to forget.

One particular vexing case study is a friend of mine who complains of making sandwiches while on Ambien. She wakes up in the morning with jello, chicken and bread -- gone, except partially eaten in what appears to be a sandwich. If one makes a sandwich and no one sees was it actually a sandwich? A question for the ages or until she just gives up and stops keeping food in her house.

3147,2024-06-01,2.1,"APEX Legends: A Disappointing Descent into Chaos

I've given APEX Legends a fair shot, but after countless hours of gameplay, I must say it has been a frustrating and underwhelming experience. Here‚Äôs why I think APEX Legends fails to live up to the hype:

Balancing Issues:
The game suffers from severe balancing issues. Certain legends are far too overpowered, making the selection process feel unfair and unbalanced. This disparity often results in predictable and monotonous gameplay, where everyone gravitates towards the same few characters.

Technical Problems:
APEX Legends is riddled with technical problems. From frequent server issues and connectivity problems to random crashes, the technical stability of the game is a major letdown. These persistent issues disrupt the gaming experience and make it difficult to enjoy even a single session without encountering some sort of technical hiccup.

Toxic Community:
The community around APEX Legends is unfortunately quite toxic. New players are often met with hostility and unhelpfulness, which can be discouraging and off-putting. The lack of proper moderation and community management exacerbates this problem, making the overall experience unpleasant for many.

Monotonous Gameplay:
Despite the initial thrill, APEX Legends quickly becomes repetitive. The lack of meaningful updates and new content fails to keep the game fresh and engaging. The gameplay loop feels stagnant, and after a while, it‚Äôs hard to find the motivation to keep playing.

Predatory Microtransactions:
The game‚Äôs microtransaction system feels predatory and greedy. Essential items and skins are locked behind paywalls, and the random nature of loot boxes makes it even worse. This pay-to-win element detracts from the fairness and enjoyment of the game.

Poor Matchmaking:
The matchmaking system in APEX Legends is deeply flawed. Matches are often unbalanced, with new players getting thrown in with highly experienced ones, leading to a frustrating experience. The long queue times only add to the irritation.

Lack of Innovation:
APEX Legends doesn‚Äôt bring anything particularly new or innovative to the table. It feels like a derivative blend of other popular battle royale games without any standout features. The game‚Äôs initial promise of uniqueness quickly fades away, leaving a sense of unfulfilled potential.

In conclusion, APEX Legends might have started strong, but it has devolved into a mess of technical issues, poor balance, and a toxic community. There are better, more stable, and enjoyable options out there for battle royale enthusiasts. Save your time and money, and look elsewhere for your gaming fix.",False

Apex Legends, once a good battle royale game, has become frustrating due to constant network issues (high ping, packet loss, hits not registering), rampant cheating, unfairly strong controller aim assist, and unchecked config cheats. Respawn and EA seem indifferent to these problems, making the game a lost cause for regular players.

Apex Legends: A Disappointing Turn
Apex Legends used to be a top game in the battle royale scene, but now it‚Äôs gone downhill. As someone who‚Äôs casually played the game for a while, it‚Äôs really sad to see how network issues and cheaters (they‚Äôre in nearly every match) have made the game really not so fun to play.

Network Issues
The game has serious network problems. There‚Äôs almost always high ping and packet loss, which means the game lags a lot. Hits often don‚Äôt register when they should, and sometimes you get hit by enemies even after you‚Äôve gotten behind cover. These issues make the game feel really clunky and frustrating.

Unfair Controller Aim Assist
Another issue is the aim assist for controller players. While it‚Äôs supposed to help balance things between console and PC players, it‚Äôs way too strong right now. This gives controller users an unfair edge over those using a mouse and keyboard.

Then there are the config cheats. Configs are macros, so yes they are cheats. These are setups that let players do complex movements effortlessly, which normal players can‚Äôt do (atleast not consistently). It‚Äôs basically cheating, but it often goes unnoticed.

It‚Äôs really frustrating to see players cheating so openly with no fear of getting caught. The anti-cheat system, Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC), is a joke. The name Easy Anti-Cheat says it all. EAC once issued a warning to my friend for having two mice connected (he uses different mice for work and games), but it can't detect the actual cheaters though. Cheaters can keep on ruining games without any consequences.

What‚Äôs even more frustrating is that the developers/publisher, Respawn/EA, don‚Äôt seem to care. Even though there‚Äôs a ton of evidence and reports from players, they‚Äôre not taking serious action against cheaters. It seems like they don‚Äôt want to ban cheaters because it might reduce the number of players, but this just drives away honest players.

Apex Legends used to be a great game with exciting gameplay, but now it‚Äôs struggling with too many issues. Network issues, cheating, overpowered aim assist, and unchecked configs have made it a mess. Until the developers take real steps to fix these problems, the game will keep losing its appeal.",False

This may sound like I'm just complaining about me being bad at the game but I have been discouraged to play and get better because of the matchmaking. In most of the matches I've played I've had to fight enemies who were hundreds of levels above me. I'm talking about me, a level 33 player, being in matches with level 500+ enemies. How do you fight against someone who has double or triple the amout of time and skill in the game? It could also seem a bit weird that I'm only level 33 with 100 hours played. That is because most of the time I've spent just being in the practice range playing against my friends with many different weapons and loadouts to get better. It helped only a little bit. Now I don't actually know how Apex' matchmaking system works exactly. So it could be totally normal and I'm complaining about nothing. Or maybe I'm just not cut out for battle royale.

3558,2024-05-28,1003.5,"I have played this game a lot and if you look at my game hours you will realize that I have played this game for almost 1000 hours.
I can say that I enjoyed 30% of the 1000 hours of gaming experience, and the rest was difficult and disappointing.
There are many high and good players in this game and if you stop playing this game and want to play again, it will be very difficult for you to return to the previous level. So this game is considered a hard game and you are behind the game.
My other problem with this game is that you need to play at least 2-3 hours a day to get the minimum rewards, and if you don't spend in this game, the company doesn't care. And it doesn't look at how much time you spent on this game, on the other hand, there are a lot of cheaters and fraudsters in this game and it makes this game difficult for you.
In general, according to these, I can say that I may continue to play this game, but it is only to continue and not to lose the prizes, and if I have more time, I can continue playing the game, I will definitely leave the game and the game I will play another game, and if I make sure that I reach the minimum, I will definitely play another game, and I am sure that there are games that the developer company cares a lot about for an ordinary player like me, and they value me a lot.
In general, I think that if someone installs this game for the first time and after knowing the conditions of the game, he will choose to play another game (if he can).
In general, I can say that this game is a normal game and in the current world there are much, much better games for you to spend your time playing.

I could have played 50 other majestic single-player games instead.

Game is great if you want to release your repressed anger:
- noob teammates that make you die
- enemies that shoot you through doors
- you take more damage from abilities than from bullets
- servers that throw you out of ranked and make you receive penalty
- lag that makes you teleport through time and space

So basically you download with the promise of dopamine but instead you end up worse than before.
Life was so much better before Apex Legends. Please play other games, or take walks at the park.

Coming in late to the sh*t show of a family gathering the waitress she never acknowledged me when she came to drop off the appetizers. After my niece reminded her that she had a drink order for the bar she rolled her eyes and turned abruptly and left to get the drink when she came back I asked could I order something. When she finally took my order you could blatantly see she was visibly annoyed that I had joined my family gathering to which my nieces informed me that she had been acting as if she hated having to provide the customer service she should been trained more properly to do. While she was taking my order the store manager Donna brought over the margarita that was ordered at the same time the appetizers were ordered. I asked while each team member was standing there for a glass of Apple juice in a margarita glass with a side of lime. Kilen and Donna walked a away and after several minutes Kilen returned with a regular mug glass with apple juice not even with lime on the side. When I reminded her that the glass I requested she breath very heavily rolled her eyes and snatched the glass from the table mumbling something derogatory under her breath and stated with as much attitude she could muster "" all right"" as if I was inconveniencing her with her plans for waiting on our table. So I asked another waitress to send the manager over to our table once she walked away because she was being overtly rude to us the customer. The manager comes over listens to my complaints agreeing reluctantly with what all of us were saying about her behavior. During this exchange the waitress comes in listening distance from another empty table hears a little of the conversation about what we're telling the manager and then abruptly shoved on the chairs across the floor making a loud scrapping sound and storms off huffing and puffing and starts to cry at this point as if we did something to her negatively like she didn't deserve for this inappropriate behavior to be reported. I could not believe the exchange that was taking place in basically empty restaurant. While I waited for my food to get to the table I explained again to the manager how this energy and action should not have to be exercised by the staff she seemed very unmoved by pleas for better service and stood with a blank face looking at me as if I were alien. The manager then changes gears as if it's our fault as the customer that the waitress is so upset and crying and tried to my excuses switching the focus to the waitress emotional breakdown from her own behavior. By the end of the visit this manager tells me point blank to my face that I'm in the wrong for making her staff upset after I catch her and the whole rest of the wait staff on the kitchen portion of the restaurant discussing my reaction to being treated rudely and abrasive by the waitress in this scenario. I don't know when it became the customer responsibility to make sure that the wait staff has a good experience at a restaurant. I have always thought it was the other way around. But the manager goes on to tell me I didn't handle the situation correctly because I had her staff member upset. It's like wow Chili's that how your employees are trained to treat the people that make a choice to eat in your restaurant.

This game has a fun gameplay loop but its overshadowed by EA's disgusting greedy microtransactions. While they are cosmetic only, its very clear that they are given priority over any new innovations to the gameplay formula. I can count on one hand how many good changes they have made for the gameplay over 5 years. Like upgrading the shields through damage done as well as teamplay (ie. revives, rezzes, collecting EVO caches).
They took the guns from Titanfall, they took the setting from Titanfall, they took the experience from Titanfall (minus the best part: TITANS) and watered it down until it was just there to sell their ugly overpriced skins.

Unfortunately it is a fun game and I keep coming back to it despite the frustrations. But as I just stated, the majority of it comes from Titanfall. EA is never going to make Titanfall 3 so this is the best we get.

This game is only fun due to the source movement, but you are actively throwing your matches if you don't use a controller. The controller aim assist is entirely indistinguishable from aimbot. This is especially bad because EA doesn't actually remove cheaters, so you're left spectating the person who killed you questioning if you should even report them, because you genuinely can't tell if the person you're watching is cheating or just using a controller.
I'm sure there are a bunch of controller players that are crawling out of the cracks to screech about how ""it's fair because I MnK have more control.""
To that I reply:
1. 80% of Apex Pred players are controller.
2. The large majority of ALGS teams have fully switched to controller. Even well known MnK players such as ImperialHal, Jmwfps, ReptarRB, and TSM Albralelie have switched because of the clear advantage it gives.
3. No, movement does not counter it in any capacity:

Mande shows why Aim Assist needs to be NERFED before the next ALGS.. Welcome back to another Apex Legends - Funny Moments & Best Highlights video.

(No, this is not the only clip, I can pull hundreds of clips of proof.)
4. Controller and MnK First person shooters are not made for controllers, they're are just adapted as such because it makes companies more money. Crossplay should only be for casual people playing with their friends, it shouldn't be balanced around ""equalizing"" objectively different inputs by allowing a computer to do 90% of the work for one.

Want to play a gamemode that isn't battle royale? Every Single ""mixtape"" (non-br gamemode) lobby is of bot accounts, that are all just afking for exp to sell the accounts so that cheater can bypass the ""level 50 requirement"" for ranked! :D

Oh right, the non-br gamemodes that have just been cycled through season after season after season, with no new updates or twists of any kind. Don't worry, every season we get multiple events! That are just full of recolored skins.



It's EA, I'm not sure what I'm expecting- It's a classic EA cashgrab carried so hard by the art team that I'm surprised they're not all in the hospital for spinal fractures.

i would be fine with the anticheat being a little aggressive if there was any evidence that it has improved the cheating situatuion in the game. but the devs arent even ALLOWED to talk about the cheating situation. we dont get to know how many bans are being made, what the health of the game is, anything like that.

the game is dying. its been dying for a long time. there;s really no reason to play it anymore. poorly managed. its a buggy, cheater ridden mess and theyre removing features instead of adding them to try and manage the dwindling player count. first, arenas was removed because no one was playing battle royal, then duos was removed because adding solos without removing duos would have split the playerbase too much. if you dont have enough players for multiple modes, removing content isnt the fix. the fix is investing in your game, creating MORE content so you will get more players. dying game. dont waste your time.",False

3759,2024-05-26,519.7,"This review comes from a casual solo player

I still really like the core of this game, the battle royal has it's problems and i feel that most reviews focus on that.
so i'll focus this review more on the mixtape game mode.

Prologue:Arenas
I used to mostly play arenas before mixtape was introduced, it had it's problems (mostly matchmaking) but still was very fun. according to Respawn itself:

Arena's not reaching it's audience is kinda sad, but understandable reason for removing the game mode. On the other hand is giant BS. It was a great place to learn how to fight in 3v3. Personally i think introduction of a 3rd team would've make it more interesting, because many battles in battle royal involve a third party. Other than that the use of own budget at the start of each round was a great way to learn weapons that you normally wouldn't use. the limited amount of abilities per round uses makes you learn how to use them in the most useful/impactful way in teamfights.
That being said,


The fact that most mixtape maps are just a cutout from the battle royal map rubs me the wrong way and causes more problems in their respected game modes, I also find it kind of annoying that the same maps keep being in rotation. Biggest 3 problems i have with mixtape are:
1) they're short --> a lot of people get their dailies this way, after joining they either don't play or leave afterwards.
2)Most lobbies consist of Master players and players that haven't reached lvl 100 --> since you still fight in 'teams' (for some reason) you can easily tell who is going to win before the game even begins and most of the times it's very one-sided.
3) There's a lot of server lag at the moment --> if you use a marksman gun en have a shootout with someone, all they have to do is: spam left right and somehow your bullets just fly through then without damaging them from the other side if someone shoots you while you run towards cover you somehow die while already in cover away from their sight. this problem is rather specific and i'd understand if people will just call it a


If you really want to win in this mode don't even think about trying out guns that you're uncomfortable with. Most of the time the random selection of guns doesn't really make any sense and since everyone can choose the same 2 guns, what's the point of giving people the option of guns that most players don't even consider using? This game mode specifically from verticality. In battle royal verticality is borderline awesome. escaping enemies, flanking enemies and moving on, it's a good experience. but in deathmatch you don't really have a reason to move on, so the winning team mostly just camp on high ground, combine that with the matchmaking and you'll notice the game being more of a 'try to climb this greasy pole' (for the losing team) and less of a normal deathmatch.


This game mode is the best in the mixtape. I wish this mode utilized the weapon selection better, the mission 'capture this point' feels more of stretching the game instead of 'let's try helping the losing team' and the lockout-event should be way shorter, cause even if you're really losing it's easy to take that point back, taking the point back feel like a game stretch (again). Most of these complains aren't that big of a deal, because overall all the pieces that are used in mixtape fit control very well.


Lockdown is by far the worst game mode of all, most of the players don't really care of capturing the points and just play it as if it's a deathmatch. the maps are also horrible for this kind of game mode. The first team that captures a point don't really play the game while having the point: While having the point, the other teams will start fighting each other before even able to reach the point. the rewards for capturing a point are also questionable, most of the time it's a red-tier weapon (which is fine) combined with gold sniper. The problem with snipers in lockdown is that the maps aren't really made for sniping and with most points being inside, makes it even more useless. Also the spawnpoints are horrible, obviously the team that spawns the closest to the next point will capture the point, bringing me back to 'the maps aren't made for this game mode'


This game mode has the same problems as deathmatch, but since you don't choose your own weapon solves half of it's own problems. Other than that (and core mixtape problems) this mode is fine.



i don't think Respawn succeeded with ''bringing something that allows players a little more relaxed play.'' In practice there's no real reason to win or lose in this game mode, you don't really get rewarded in any case. Also the main game went through some changes in the past few seasons, meanwhile mixtape feels pretty much unchanged.
I would love to see these game modes translated into a one man experience, without needing a team (but still allow people to join in groups).


The best way to play this game is with a premate squad of 3 people.
this game can be enjoyable when played with 2. The random is going to be more miss than hit, nonetheless there are still fun people that play this game.
if you're very competitive, you might enjoy this game.
If you're looking for a casual / solo experience, i'd recommend looking elsewhere or joining a community that you enjoy and play together.
Lastly, if you enjoy spending money on useless items that won't help improve the game in any way, you are the perfect demographic for this game.",False

its matchmaking. the first 2 or 3 matches were fine. but after that the game starts placing you in lobbies with player that have THOUSANDS of hours in the game levels 200 And up. as a new player you have no chance. you are dead before you even can figure out what you are doing wrong. you are pitted agenst players who feast on new players such as yourself and even if you get a high level player on your squad you still get nowhere as they do not care if you cant keep up or even understand what is happening.

honestly i would not recommend this to any new players. there is no point in playing a game where you get put agenst others who have had the time to learn the game while you cant make it 10 feet from your landing zone before getting wiped by a squad of level 300 players. fix the matchmaking. and this game will be better for everyone.",False

3898,2024-05-25,70.5,"Average apex experience: My buddy and I have to play trios when we want to play duos, simply because they are incapable of having more than one game mode at a time. Next we try to find a spot to land, pick and go, excited to play the game, due to our past experience in earlier seasons. We land at what seems to be a semi popular spot, we have experience in other shooter games, and our aim is, semi-decent. I'm not saying I'm the aiming god, but I used to be able to land enough shots to get some kills back in seasons 1-10ish, we land we get into a fight, I'm obviously playing mirage because. Well yeah. I'm actually quite a good mirage player so I can get some fun tricks done and it's a fun time. At least it was. Till all of a sudden the game decides that the level 53 player who has about... 4 wins total over 70 hours(at the time) should go against 60,000 kill bloodhound masters players. My friend and I get smoked immediately and it's back to the lobby. Repeat this about 2-3 times, then get off and play something else.

I want to improve, I really do, and I know this seems like a skill issue, but how can I get better when I barely get a chance to fight? Fights last less than 5 seconds most of the time and I am left sitting wondering what happened. I really used to love this game, my time on play-station was credible back in the early pre-season to season 6 days. This game has character, it has soul. It has something that is really a great concept that truly could be built upon to be better. But instead it is plagued with sweaty players, soulless character releases, scummy company money grabs, and overall terrible matchmaking. I will continue to play this game, because I do know eventually if I slam myself at the brick wall that is Apex enough times I'll get through it and actually be able to play and have fun again. But for now I can barely play 2 games, due to the constant flood of high skill players in my lobbies. It sounds bad to say but even fortnite has better skill based matchmaking than this. Most games now can have at least semi competent matchmaking where the highest level players in the game aren't put with the bottom of the barrel. I know it is casual, but that's exactly it, casual. something for the boys to just hop on and play, something where you don't win all the time, have to work for a win, but also don't get curb stomped by top level players.

I really do want to recommend this game, I want to praise it and give it the love it deserves. But I can't. I don't have fun playing this game. I don't think many other low level players will have fun playing this game either. Like I said earlier, I'm still gonna play, just to try to get better, but I already have tons of knowledge about the game. I can't imagine how it is like for a 100% new player to just. Hop in, see what it's all about. Then get absolutely CRUSHED as they play in their first match after the exhibition ones

TLDR: It's a great game at its core but it is just surrounded by so many matchmaking issues and other common gaming issues that it's almost impossible for new players to pick up, or returning players to hop back in. I can't recommend it now, But hopefully in the future it'll improve.",False

This is a good option for a ""secondary"" game. I play it if I don't see anything fun to do with my main games. The matches are quick. You can compensate for bad teammates and don't drag your teammates down as much compared to MOBA games. It is a close-range arcade-style battle royal FPS. If you want, you can play long range (300 meters or more) even if it is not optimal for ranking up. Using terrain and positioning can win you games. Using a slope or roof as cover, moving without being seen, and letting unsuspecting squads fight each other are rewarded in-game.

Cons:
You are rewarded for practicing aiming with your mouse. You need to adjust your sensitivity and track targets on screen. This is a con for me because I hate practicing repetitive tasks like combos or mouse movement. If you like it, it's a plus.

In every match, your armor level is tied to the number of shots you land. Playing safe can set you behind. You need to take other ""objectives"" around the map to get ""evolution points"" and level up armor. As a counter-balance, abilities matter, but they can be offset with good shooting.

Durability and mobility are very high. You can hit an enemy in the head with a pistol, automatic rifle, or sniper rifle and they will definitely survive two shots.",True

no

The same bugs are there, same issues, and same bs. They will not fix this game. They dedicated too much afford into making solid team for their publisher having wet dreams over skins, re-colours, and possibilities of a sale figure to overcompensate how little they actually care.

While they continue to be the best money-making game for EA, players get to experience what it's like to axiomatically be deaf and schizophrenic because this game provides no real time audio.

also enemies have the luxury of portraying as Wesley from Wanted because their bullets will bend to you as you're shot behind a cover.

fun game-play and all that, just don't get sucked into its trash monetization like i get a game needing to make money, I don't get a re-skin of a $500 item, that's just ridiculous and made me quit the game (yes i quit when heirloom recolors came out cause that's beyond trash)

only sad part (aside from the trash monetization) is that its published by EA and I will not be playing much EA games anymore.. its the age of the Indie Dev.

im only playing to get my achievements from PS4 on here. Welp have a good day!

this game gave me hell of a time the old squad and hours of fun with friends dropping in trying to just survive, buts its no longer worth it unless the squad wants to play again, and we all moved to bigger better games. *cough* baldurs gate 3 *cough*

The gameplay is high contane based mainly around mobility (not as much as Titanfall) and includes really interesting movement techs like superslides.

I had loved this game for a long while about 2 years ago. Its fast paced, you can collect items for free without having to pay and there are different game modes to enjoy. After 350 hours of non stop love for the game it became filled with cheaters. From wall hacks to aim bots, I had to quit the game out of frustration. Then to make matters worse, they removed my all time favorite (and only reason why I played) arenas game mode. Despite desperately missing the game, the combination of the insane cheaters and no arena mode made me leave the game uninstalled for 2 years, occasionally checking back in case things changed. Finally, I am able to enjoy the game again after all that time. Though arenas has still made no return, matchmaking has treated me better. The game is fast paced like I've always loved, but I don't have to sweat my 4$$ off just to get one kill. Now I'll be waiting on arenas to hopefully make it's return and my love for the game will grow to its highest again.",True

4369,2024-05-21,140.2,"I have just over 70 hours in this game and I started only 1.5 month ago or something. I can confidently say I am a new rookie player that mostly played solo and managed to get to Bronze III. Game has great potential but for me it is the most unfriendly game for newcomers I have seen so far. Here all the pros and cons:
PROS:
- The maps

- The game modes (incl. the main battle royale)

- I haven't seen too many toxic players compared to other games I played (Battlefront 2, LoL), This might be tied to my casual skill level though.

- Tools like death recap, spectating and hit feedback are all great to have, should be in more games

CONS:
- Matchmaking, I have already seen a consistent amount of far, far better players than me. if you want to play the game as newbie, be prepared to face god like squads and players with god like aim right from the get go. You should be happy with like 1 kill every 5 matches in the beginning.

- Cheating, Even though the game has kernel level anti cheat (which is evil in its nature), presented as silver bullet against cheating, I have already seen a fair amount of cheating. The death recap and spectating does help a lot in spotting them

- Poor hit registration, audio registration and low tick servers ruin many 1 v 1 or squads vs squads

- This might be more a personal issue, the aiming and hitting feels clumsy in this game. Bullets have a fairly low velocity while the player movement is very fast compared to other games. Also the inaccuracy of the hip fire is so bad most players use their optics consistently even on players that are like 10 meters away. That feels awkward as well.",False

4419,2024-05-20,35.3,"Apex Legends: A Solid Battle Royale Experience with Room for Improvement

Apex Legends, developed by Respawn Entertainment, is a popular battle royale game that has carved out a niche for itself with its unique blend of team-based gameplay, character abilities, and fast-paced action. Since its surprise launch in 2019, it has maintained a strong player base and continues to evolve with regular updates and new content.

Gameplay and Mechanics:
The core gameplay of Apex Legends is solid and engaging. The emphasis on team play, with each player selecting a ""Legend"" with unique abilities, sets it apart from other battle royales. The movement mechanics are smooth and fluid, allowing for dynamic and strategic encounters. The ping system is a standout feature, providing excellent communication options for teams without the need for voice chat.

Visuals and Performance:
Visually, Apex Legends is impressive. The game features a colorful and vibrant art style that stands out in the crowded battle royale genre. Performance-wise, it runs well on a variety of hardware, though some players have reported occasional issues with server stability and connectivity.

Content and Updates:
Respawn consistently adds new content, including Legends, maps, and limited-time events. While this keeps the game fresh, some updates have been met with mixed reactions from the community. Balancing issues and the introduction of new mechanics can sometimes disrupt the game's equilibrium.

Monetization and Cosmetics:
Apex Legends is free-to-play, with monetization primarily through cosmetic items. The in-game store offers a range of skins and other cosmetics, though the pricing has been a point of contention for some players. The battle pass system provides additional content and rewards, offering good value for those who engage with it regularly.

Community and Support:
The community around Apex Legends is generally positive and active. Respawn's support and communication with players are decent, though there are occasional complaints about the responsiveness to player feedback, especially concerning balancing and bug fixes.

Conclusion:
Apex Legends remains a strong contender in the battle royale genre. Its unique character abilities, team-focused gameplay, and smooth mechanics provide a distinctive experience. However, issues with balance, monetization, and occasional performance hiccups indicate there is still room for improvement. Overall, it's a solid choice for fans of the genre, offering both excitement and challenges.

4655,2024-05-18,704.8,"If you crave frustration and disappointment, look no further than Apex Legends for an abysmal server experience. Prepare for your PC or laptop to spontaneously give up on life, crushed under the sheer incompetence of the game's unstable performance. Even a 1000Mbps connection won't save you from the relentless lag induced by Apex Legends' abysmal servers. When stacking up against its competitors, Apex Legends stands out for all the wrong reasons, showcasing embarrassingly inferior server performance. While Valorant maintains a somewhat respectable 120ms server latency, Apex Legends shamefully lags behind at a mere 20ms. The disparity continues with Valorant's robust anti-cheat system, a stark contrast to Apex Legends' flimsy implementation of EasyAntiCheat, essentially rolling out a red carpet for hackers. The lack of repercussions for cheaters is no surprise, considering the game's questionable decision to skimp on banning measures for the sake of saving a few bucks, resulting in a hacker-ridden wasteland. As if the gameplay woes weren't enough, Apex Legends gouges its player base with exorbitant skin prices and shameless exploitation through predatory and anti-consumer gambling strategies.

Other things-
- First account got banned because some hacker got into my account when i stopped playing for 6 months and used hacks in game. Its my problem that i didn't enable 2FA but when evidence of not touching the game during that period of time was presented to them the support simply just brushed me off without providing their own concrete evidence of me cheating in game. f that
- Sydney servers has no players and the one game i had was with a white guy screaming at me for looting for 2 seconds and then pushing enemies into their own death for no reason so never again
- Joins Singapore servers expecting intelligent Singaporean players instead of players from Ch* and In* that don't play with the team and then proceeds to talk ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• when they die first. When you lose a fight you look at the map and of course that one random is a country away from your position, at this point i don't even want to scream into my mic anymore. Keep in mind i always play with my duo. Just don't solo in trios you'll hate your life.
- Bunch of tryhards trying to teach you how to play the game in game but most of the time they make the worst decisions ever that leads your team into death because you try to stick to that one random
- The other game modes were more fun than the main competitive br mode which is funny
- I think the game is still dominated by controller players? been away for a long time idk (dented people will tell you to get good)

In conclusion, play this game if you love wasting your life away. Me thinking that OW2 is more fun than this game says a lot about this goofy ahh game. Don't bother.",False

These grifts are constantly shilled and Electronic Arts has the bones to do so rightfully. One can argue that it is a good thing that video games as a whole are inept as it might inspire people to have more real experiences and activity and therefore opens the door for more opportunities in life. though one thing is most certain, that if these pathetic excuses for video games are indeed ""the future of gaming"" then by all means let them be the ones to erode it sooner rather than later. I will choose to live in a world that has no fond memory of video games rather than a world that pretends and mockingly suggests that this could ever be considered good. at what good work is shown here? hot topic models running around blasting each other? it is an actual ugly joke and is catered to simple minded incompetent people or at the very least suggests so. that being said, you don't have to be smart to know of their horrible designs and lack of creativity so only time can tell the story of the biggest lackluster ""game"" of all time.",False

4845,2024-05-17,111.6,"I don't know what to say... I have played this game a lot on another account on the Origin AKA now as the 'EA' platform, and I've spent 1000+ hours on this game. Here I am reviewing it right here, and still, I seriously don't know what to say... about this game. Go ahead and try out the Battle Royale mode if you want and see how ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• hard your ass could get beat. It's very draining and exhausting sometimes to get your ass beat up so hard like that.

Sometimes it feels like it ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• on you with the randoms that you are teamed up with, the server connection problems, or just straight up ridiculously difficult situations that feel like nothing but hopeless; sometimes it's just looting over and over again all over and around the map until you end up meeting your cruel fate to be destroyed by some sweaty ass squad or some sweaty ass player, sometimes a trio of 3 that are friends who usually play together that destroy you, and it happens whether you try to be nice and supportive or not, whether you are very careful and cautious or not... it's frustrating. Does that mean that the game just completely sucks ? No, it doesn't completely suck because they have made it very catchy throughout the seasons as they have added multiple features to multiple weapons, to multiple maps and to multiple modes... yada yada yada... The point is! That they have created something cool here, cool and so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• deadly. I wouldn't talk about the 'agendas' or the backstories of some of the characters, as that doesn't interest me neither do I give a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about such a thing in such an online-based game like this, nor do I care about the skins they make and add (I can hardly look at one that makes me feel like it's genuine) or the bundles or the micro-transaction-like nature in the game.

Also, let me tell you ? You wanna get good at this game? You could get good at this game at some point but even then that just doesn't ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• cut it. If you go ahead and play with randoms, then just forget about any good and solid chance of winning and being the champion, so you just ought to play this game with friends whom you know and have a good sense of communication with (even then that doesn't cut it, btw), and you would have to get online with them when they do to play together and have a good chance at winning, but more importantly, I really want to say that, Regardless of all of that mentioned above, you really could get stuck (or sucked) in this game ending up not knowing just how to stop or let go and just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• end it where it should, it really could get messy and gets you hooked on winning or ""scoring"" as the champion or whatever you wanna call it (because some people don't even play to win as champion to begin with) while feeling it's just going nowhere, really nowhere... play if you want and see how it's crazy, so crazy, it's biggest problem lies in overdosing, overdosing that adrenaline rush and playing without quitting or stopping... I swear it's probably the closest way I've gotten to time travel in this life (based in the senses that I have that I observe with), because you just really lose sense of time when playing... Those who want that adrenaline kick (or charge) can surely find lots of that here but don't go complaining when it gets crazy and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• tense. Regardless, does that justify pain, the agony, the suffering, the torment and the frustration that comes with it? No, I don't think so, simply because that IS just NOT how I want to feel, I want to feel good, like I am on fire and not worried about having to be so careful to get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• right where the smallest mistake can ruin it all, I don't want to be so serious like that. I am tired of this match-in match-out loop. Don't want to be depressed, sad or agitated because I didn't get the right ""thing"" or go with the right teammate or because it didn't go well while jumping from one match to another anymore, don't want that and all the crazy ass grinding anymore, seriously... Unless I get to know WHERE THE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it's going, if it's going anywhere... at all,.

It's just boom here, boom there. Kill leader this, kill leader that. Champion win, champion dead. And it just doesn't stop... Face it; I know it's like this, like there is some toxicity (maybe not from one teammate to another but between us and ourselves), some dysfunction leading to frustration, anger, dissatisfaction, and agitation. Sometimes I can't stop rolling my eyes while playing, waiting for me to discover one thing I can depend or count on in this game to help me win with or without randoms... but still, until now I haven't found that. It's crazy turning on this game, getting into a match while saying ""I feel good, I feel like I am gonna win and be crazy good like on fire, lessgo I got this"" then saying ""ok, that was just a silly hiccup watch let's go again and try again"" then saying ""hold up, I got close there hol up, let get some more I got this, i got this right ?"" then saying ""wow wtf is this, did that really happen ? I'm so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• done"" then like ""wow so bad so bad wow! I can't believe this wow wtf ugh man how un-‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• believable""......... And that's it that's it basically, that's how it is. And I don't know; I just don't know FOR THE LIFE OF ME where it ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• goes, Where does it go ? Where ?

4907,2024-05-16,58.9,"It's hard for me to choose recommending this or not. On my steam account I have only just under 60 hours of playtime, but I mainly played this on xbox where I spent hundreds maybe even a thousand hours playing the game.

The biggest reason I opted to give it a negative review is in the matter of loss of enjoyment. Back when I started playing, I believe it was around season 2 or 3 forgive me for being too lazy to go look lol, I was a little slow getting into it battle royales just weren't really fun for me. But I was really drawn in by the gameplay with each character having a unique set of abilities and I think that's something that's been improved with all the new characters added in since even though I never touched them and more so with this new perk system. It had it flaws here and there of course but they weren't always that big of a pain.

Of course back then when I started, matches were actually fun! Sure there were times there was a run in with someone much higher skilled at the game, but that was all it was at the time. A bad match. I never felt like I was stuck in a hopeless loop of loss after loss, immediate death after immediate death such as I have in these last 3-5 seasons. I tried to give it a break, see if maybe I was just growing overall too frustrated when I played, but when I came back it seemed like I was just incapable of doing half of what I could when I had first started playing. Every lobby I join seems plagued with full teams of level 500 predators and there's just no escape from it.

There is some very interesting lore inside the game surrounding the different maps and characters and I really like the way things are headed, aside from matchmaking obviously, and I want to follow the story but this isn't something I can easily enjoy without friends to rage at getting instant wiped with. So if you have at least one other friend to play with, I believe you could still have fun even with the imbalance. Push through it and with some luck of the drop progress will be made.

After 1,300+ hours I've lost the love for Apex on MNK. I really tried to learn as much as I could and I've gotten pretty good, the problem is most people are cheating or are using a controller for AA and unless you are also using a controller, you are SHREDDED in seconds if you don't get the first hits.
Respawn seems unreliable and weird with updates and plans for game changes so it's unlikely this game will ever change aim assist on PC. Also get ready to be bullied by your randoms as Respawn has no actual report support so you'll be called every slur under the sun for doing literally anything.
Maybe if they actually address the cheating and aim assist problem, it'll be decent. At it's core Apex is a REALLY fun game. But for now... honestly just move onto something different if you are looking for a casual game.",False

4926,2024-05-16,430.1,"Apex Legends... where do I even begin? This so-called ""battle royale masterpiece"" is nothing short of a frustrating mess from start to finish. Strap in, because this review is going to be one wild ride through disappointment and rage.

Let's start with the gameplay mechanics, or lack thereof. Apex Legends prides itself on its fast-paced action and dynamic movement, but in reality, it's just a chaotic mess of random encounters and mindless shooting. The gunplay feels clunky and unresponsive, and don't even get me started on the hit detection - it's like trying to hit a fly with a baseball bat blindfolded.

And then there's the map design. Oh boy, where do I even begin? The map in Apex Legends is a convoluted maze of indistinguishable corridors and open spaces, making navigation a nightmare. It's like the developers threw a bunch of random assets together and called it a day, with no regard for flow or balance.

But perhaps the most infuriating aspect of Apex Legends is its matchmaking system. I swear, it's like the game goes out of its way to pair you with the most incompetent teammates imaginable. Whether they're AFK in the spawn area, looting every nook and cranny while you're bleeding out, or just straight-up ignoring your pings, playing with randoms is a surefire way to raise your blood pressure to dangerous levels.

And don't even get me started on the microtransactions. It's like the developers are actively trying to nickel and dime you at every turn, with overpriced cosmetics and loot boxes galore. It's insulting, really, that they expect us to fork over our hard-earned cash for virtual pixels that offer no real value.

In conclusion, Apex Legends is a train-wreck of a game that's not worth the bandwidth it takes to download. From its lackluster gameplay to its abysmal matchmaking and predatory monetization practices, it's clear that this game was rushed out the door with little regard for quality or player experience.

4942,2024-05-16,938.1,"Probably the highest quality battle royale game in the market; the diversity of characters' skill sets and their interaction with the game environment is quite impressive. Additionally, communication via both voice and shortcuts is very effective. The ping system, in particular, is highly useful. Lastly, it's quite free-to-play. You can obtain each season's battle pass and numerous skins without spending a single cent. The game stays lively with frequent updates introducing different game modes. Overall, it's the top choice if you're into battle royale.

Now, let's talk about the problems; aside from the typical toxic player base and inevitable cheats in such popular games, some characters' abilities provide clear advantages over others. As in classic online games, in the name of balancing, there's a shift in the ""meta,"" sometimes resulting in abilities being nerfed to the point of being unusable. For example, Valkyrie, or on the contrary, some characters receive buffs well beyond what's necessary, like Mad Maggie. One of the most common issues is the lack of any punishment system in-game, leading to players frequently leaving matches after being knocked down, putting your team at a disadvantage. Finally, while matchmaking isn't bad at lower and mid-levels, it can go out of control at higher tiers, matching you with hardcore psychos who play 24/7.

In summary, it's a highly quality battle royale game worth giving a shot. Unfortunately, it still deals with the chronic issues of competitive online gaming.",True

Dude EA I know you probably make money through boosters but common man. Letting people only have to wait 1 season for a HARD RANK RESET...
A free game mythic skins that cost $168 cough cough octane and every other mythic before hand in the event AT ITS CHEAPEST. The game is flooded with cheap recolor skins to say you got something in a pack. I might actually stop playing.
I am literally going against TOP TIER in SILVER ( let that sink in)... and if you get one fancy badge on your team they think its season 18 and just rat on the edge of the map all game with a fake accent and a huge ego...(aka a bought account on PLAYER AUCTIONS to play ranked on)",False

Anytime I decide I want to put myself through hell, I simply play this game. I'm always guaranteed the same deck of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•: New non-meta weapons taking up ground loot, a new legend that will take 10-20 eons to fix after release, servers that make me think I'm an African child who thought ""This games free, must be worth my time."" Just to turn out that the saying ""Nothing's free"" holds indefinitely true because of the 4 letters that even make this game relevant just so happens to be ""free."" This game is not worth your time, your friend's, your family's, or even your dog's. Nobody looks at reviews before ""purchasing"" free games, but if little Timmy's parents happen to orbit their kid and need to know whats lurking in the corners of their 7 and a half year old's computer, they better find this review, hopefully right before Timmy gets sent to eternal damnation when he's 30, jobless, and stuck playing this brutally idiotic game (Which shouldn't even be classified as a game anymore)

The mobile version of this game got more content than the base game, talk about ""pleasing"" the younger generations. While I'm on the topic of pleasing, let's talk about those employees, Respawn. No, don't want to? Multi-billion dollar company up your ass? Well that's too bad considering they're doing exactly what they did with PvZ 2 Garden Warfare to this game. Ever played that glorious game before, it's euphoric, but it just so happens they made a spin off that was at least forty times worse. Begging the question, when's Apex Legends 2 coming out? Hopefully never, or else that'll give me two reasons to set fire to my PC and throw it into the head of EA's main office

At the end of the day, you're better off playing Fortnite, Warzone, TF2, the other TF2, stardew valley, minecraft, Deep Rock Galactic, Dauntless, monster hunter world, Any nintendo game, pal world, Any PlayStation Original, any Xbox original, any pc exclusive game, terraria, hell I think you'd have more fun in T mod loader as well.

I put myself through the satanic ritualistic act of opening and playing this game on the hellish occasion, so you don't have to become like me, Timmy, or any Apex Legends e-sports member.

This game has increasingly (if possible) focused on ridiculously over priced skins, I mean who pays for gun skins. They are just adding more content in which you should pay for, it ludicrous. Aside from that my main argument is taking away Duos which I played for the past 2 years. Now Im either forced to play alone, or in a 3 with my friend and a total stranger who normally runs into the enemy then dies. The community are of players are pretty hostile and so doesn't make you want to play in a 3.

Fact of the matter is all Battle Royale games have zero anticheat's that work, and are always infested with cheaters. Game devs never do anything and in these sorts of games when you report anyone for cheating you get ignored or punished for 'wasting staffs time' cause they know they can't do anything about it either, so seeing as how the hacking situation has only gotten much worse after 2 years I'm going to have to say my comment is spot on.

Classes/Characters/Heroes, whatever you call them, they're imbalanced, and most of them are absolutely boring to play or have worthless skill sets that literally do nothing but set you up to get killed by enemies rather than help you kill the enemies.

Overall this is a 2/10 game. It's not fun solo, it's not fun with friends, it's not fun with hackers, it's ugly to look at, has a terrible map design layout, and the core system of the game is just the typical Battle Royale so it brings literally nothing new to the table to spice up what has always been an incredibly boring style of game.",False

Apex Legends, developed by Respawn Entertainment, has cemented its place as a standout title in the battle royale genre since its surprise release. The game offers a unique blend of satisfying gameplay mechanics, diverse characters, and a vibrant, ever-evolving world. However, its heavy reliance on microtransactions can detract from the overall experience.

Fast-Paced and Satisfying Gameplay

Apex Legends excels in providing fast-paced, exhilarating gameplay that keeps players coming back for more. The gunplay is crisp and responsive, with a wide variety of weapons that feel distinct and satisfying to use. The movement mechanics, including sliding, climbing, and ziplines, add a layer of fluidity and dynamism that sets it apart from other battle royale games.

The introduction of Legends, each with unique abilities and playstyles, brings a strategic depth to the game. Whether you're using Wraith's portals for tactical advantage, Lifeline's healing drone to support your team, or Gibraltar's shield to tank damage, the Legends‚Äô abilities complement the core gameplay and encourage team coordination.

Diverse and Engaging Maps

The maps in Apex Legends are beautifully designed and continuously updated, offering diverse environments that keep the gameplay fresh. From the sprawling urban landscape of World's Edge to the lush jungles and high-tech structures of Olympus, each map presents unique challenges and opportunities. The rotating maps ensure that players must constantly adapt their strategies, preventing the game from becoming stale.

Dynamic Seasonal Content

Respawn Entertainment has done an excellent job of keeping Apex Legends fresh with regular seasonal updates. Each season introduces new Legends, weapons, and map changes, as well as limited-time events that add new modes and challenges. This constant influx of content keeps the player base engaged and excited for what‚Äôs next.

Excessive Microtransactions

Despite its many strengths, one of the major drawbacks of Apex Legends is its heavy reliance on microtransactions. While the game is free-to-play and it's possible to earn some in-game currency through gameplay, the majority of cosmetic items, including character skins, weapon skins, and other customization options, are locked behind a paywall. The prices for these items can be quite steep, and the frequent introduction of new, appealing cosmetics can make it feel like a constant push to spend money.

The Battle Pass system, while offering some value, also incentivizes additional spending to unlock premium tiers and exclusive rewards. This can be frustrating for players who prefer to enjoy the game without feeling pressured to make constant purchases.

Conclusion

Apex Legends is a standout battle royale game that offers thrilling, fast-paced gameplay, a diverse cast of characters, and dynamic seasonal content that keeps the experience fresh and engaging. Its excellent gunplay and movement mechanics, combined with strategic team-based gameplay, make it one of the most enjoyable titles in the genre.

However, the game‚Äôs excessive microtransactions and the high cost of cosmetic items can detract from the overall experience. While the core gameplay remains free and highly enjoyable, the persistent push towards in-game purchases may frustrate some players. Despite this, Apex Legends remains a must-play for fans of battle royale games, offering a uniquely satisfying and ever-evolving experience.",True

5182,2024-05-14,188.7,"Edit: Steam asked me to revise my review. Only thing I'll add: IDK if there are THAT many hackers in this game, or THAT many people no-life Apex, but either way it's ridiculously awful for anyone that doesn't no-life this game. Some say it's controller aim-assist being ridiculously high, could be that, but no matter what the reason, it's awful.

There are three main reasons I'm going to give Apex a thumbs down.

1. Matchmaking sucks.
2. Lootbox prices matched w/ FOMO events
3. The Remote Code Exploit they just... never talked about.


1. As a casual player, the matchmaking is terrible to frustration. I have plenty of time in FPSs in general, so I get being against skilled people, but the 1,500,000 dmg Octane, or 13,000 kill Wraith in every other game really blows. I'm above average, below great, so what do I get? People with a thousand hours who've been playing since launch. It's just not fun after whatever last ""matchmaking"" update they did. Along with a tick rate worse than Among Us, I'm wondering why not maybe.... invest in some real servers? Can EA not afford those? Is that what we're pretending? They lock the Final Fantasy sword behind $300+ of loot boxes, but we can't get REAL servers so we can pretend this game works?

2. Apex Legends is the king of ""Quickly spend hundreds of dollars on this event to get this super rare thing."" The Final Fantasy event, the one directly after where you could get an heirloom... Heirlooms themselves.... Apex is considered predatory by most communities I've been a part of.

3. RCE! So during a tournament, a hacker hacked in to two machines of guys in the tournie and injected cheats in their machines. I've heard CRICKETS since then from Respawn/EA, besides like two weeks later there was a Twitter post saying they released a small security update. NOTHING about the fact a guy has claimed this attack and said it was to show off that RCE exists in the engine (but also said ""I really doubt anyone else will find it, it should be safe to play""). But to not say anything is terrifying. Do they not care? Can they not fix it? Say SOMETHING here. Edit: Update on this. After MONTHS of hearing absolutely nothing, I heard through 3rd party sources that the original hacker, Destroyer2009, has claimed that the RCE exploit he used was patched. My question? WHY DID EA AND RESPAWN SAY NOTHING? The utter VOID of communication makes me worried. They're an absolutely terrible developer considering they never told me when their game could get me hacked, and then when the WORLDWIDE tournament gets hacked and the hacker says ""LOOK HOW UNSECURE THEIR GAME IS"", you'd THINK the dev might reply with ""Hey, we took care of that SUPER dangerous exploit that was shown on the world stage, we ARE taking care of the game."" The fact they didn't has me scratching my head.

The game's fine, the movement is good, gunplay feels pretty good, but there are some glaring issues that make me say: No, I really wouldn't recommend getting in to it.",False

It doesn't seem like a widespread issue, but people are experiencing a bug that crashes framerate, tanks the ability to load assets, and produces an audio glitch where certain audio elements are delivered up to 20 seconds late.

This only started after the newest update and there is a workaround (however irritating the process may be) that involves unplugging your audio peripherals from their USB slots and then plugging them in again.

The servers constantly lag (stutter) intermittently. Developers do nothing to change how people are banned for cheating. You just make a new account after you are banned. Try hardware ban maybe?

Same thing over and over every game. When the game launched it was super fun, and exciting. Now it's just toxic people, and sweats who were inspired by some talented people on Youtube or Twitch. The MMR system is so broken it makes you fight better and better people over time to the point you will likely lose most games. I've played this game for about 3,000 hours with friends, and it was fun while it lasted. But now most of us just are tired of the same rinse, wash, repeat. Have fun.

Apex Legends is an adrenaline-fueled whirlwind of action, strategy, and teamwork that keeps you on the edge of your seat with every match. Respawn Entertainment has crafted a masterpiece in the battle royale genre, offering fluid gameplay, diverse legends with unique abilities, and constantly evolving landscapes to keep even the most seasoned players engaged.

However, behind the breathtaking vistas and heart-pounding firefights lies a growing concern that threatens to undermine the integrity of the game: cheating. While cheating has plagued online gaming for years, Apex Legends is not immune to its effects.

On consoles, the rise of devices like Cronus Zen has introduced a new level of unfair advantage, allowing players to bypass recoil and perform feats of accuracy that would be impossible without assistance. This not only creates a lopsided playing field but also diminishes the sense of accomplishment for those who strive to improve their skills through practice and dedication.

Meanwhile, on PC, the battle against cheaters has become a constant struggle. Despite the efforts of Respawn's anti-cheat systems, some players still find ways to exploit vulnerabilities, tarnishing the experience for honest gamers who just want to enjoy a fair and competitive match.

Respawn Entertainment has taken steps to address these issues, implementing measures to detect and punish cheaters, but the battle is far from over. As a community, we must remain vigilant and report suspicious behavior to ensure that Apex Legends remains a fair and enjoyable experience for all.

Despite these challenges, Apex Legends continues to stand as a shining example of what a battle royale game can achieve when crafted with passion and innovation. With its dynamic gameplay, engaging characters, and vibrant community, it remains a must-play for fans of the genre. But let us not forget the importance of upholding the principles of fair play and sportsmanship, for without them, the thrill of victory loses its meaning.",False

5389,2024-05-12,2.8,"Apex Legends is a game I have played for 4 years, and I have definitely seen its ups and downs as time passed. I would personally recommend this game not just because it is fun, but because it has its own unique characteristics in comparison to other Battle Royale games like COD Warzone and Fortnite. You can certainly look up many things about this game, but I believe that it is most likely guaranteed you will find a legend in the roster that suits you best. There is also a great amount of customization in this game (Which can be very expensive if you choose to spend money on this game), comparable to the likes of the games I mentioned prior, with extra possessions like your tailored banner. The last thing I will say before I review this game critically is that it may be tough for new players, though if you research ways to get better online you will get through it. Now, since we have sung its praises with many more that I did not mention, we must now look at what apex does not get right or what it could fix to do better. Hacking is currently rampant in apex, especially in the competitive mode as you move up the ranks. This has been a problem for a very long time, possibly dating back to season 2 (when I started playing), when I was on console so at that time hacking was barely a concern or even not a concern at all, while when I switched to PC in season 3, I personally started seeing cheaters in game as soon as season 5. It also relates to the large incident that happened in ALGS recently, where 2 players (Genburten and ImperialHal) had their game hijacked, giving them esp with full hitboxes, health, and player names, along with bullet (not aim-locking) aimbot. Hacking is the only concern I will describe in this review because it has been recent, and is a genuine concern and has been for a long time. In conclusion, while apex has many great qualities I mentioned, there are some concerns that do not have to do with how the game is intended to be played. I would personally give the game an 8.9/10, because despite its shortcomings, it is unique, it can be tailored, and most of all, it is great, but its shortcomings hinder me from giving it a 9/10 (Amazing). Opinions can differ widely on how good or bad this game is depending on who you ask, so I am not expecting you to 100% believe in my opinion, and all I ask of you is that you at the very least consider it.",True

After years of playing this game, I cannot anymore.

Season 20 has broke me. After years of this games release, the DEVs still can't make it to be skill based match making. Solos did not humble me (I know trolls are going to say something). It is unbelievably irritating that as someone who has only hit platinum in rank has to fight against predators and masters. Solos lets you see that Anti Cheat system does not work on top of the skill base match making, as you get killed by predator who only shoots in the direction they hear foot steps (knowing their aim bot will carry them to victory).

Anyway I can do a lot of movement and my aim is decent but every game I get one clipped over and over again, it has really become a game were the only requirements to be good is to play on a controller and get the right settings on the controller, and within 50-100 hours you will probably be able to reach masters rank...

5545,2024-05-11,75.1,"Pros:
- Fun gunplay
- Decent modes if you don't like battle royale as much
- Cool events
- A variety of characters to choose from
- Rotating modes to keep the gameplay fresh
- Alright visuals
- GREAT sound design: turn that up

Cons:
- Respawn is deaf; they don't care about the community
- Kill-cams ruin the game; it feels like everyone is cheating
- You are heavily pushed to spend; overpriced cosmetics
- Server issues kill you; server problems which suck for everyone, even respawn
- Bad management; published by EA, you know how that goes
- Prepare for the Grind; yeah spend hours grinding battle pass and events
- Sweats in most games; see below reason
- Almost no skill-ranking system; you can be put in a match with a level 423 and a level 4 on your team
- A surprisingly long match-making queue; almost 300k people can be online but it still takes forever to get into a game, even one with no other people except you in it like the FIRING RANGE (just you and your party to practice mechs)
- Does not run that well on lower-end systems; yeah. also if you usually get more than 30 ping in a game you are screwed because that will turn into 300 with the bad servers

Overall:
4/10 - Please fix your game; worse than Team Fortress 2 in terms of ""cheaters"" - Go play Titan Fall
Most of the pros don't matter when you consider the cons, like the gunplay fails with the poor servers and the mode rotation sucks when it's full of sweats and cheaters",False

5665,2024-05-11,187.5,"APEX LEGENDS SUCKS

Why does Apex Legends suck?
This game is pretty good looking and all but there is a huge cheating problem.
The usual quickplay games are either full of cheaters or full of trash players which just doesnt make sense.
Bad players have some chance of getting kills but thats very rare in quickplay. Quickplay is so ruined by these cheaters or whatever they are that it ruins the mood to play quick games and just makes you rage. The same cheating problem applies to Squads and Duos. Its usually not that bad but some players just win solo in a squad gamemode which is suspicious and confusing. TLDR Apex has cheaters in all gamemodes but especially in Quickplay

Its literally from Titanfall universe. Maps are beautiful, guns are beautiful, skins are beautiful, everything graphically looks amazing. Legends are fine (except for the new legend ((forgot her name)), too OP ). Little secrets and the battlepass. Thats all? Uhh maybe yeah idk

Well, where to start, tbh.. when i first started playing on console, i got Diamond in S7 on the last day of ranked season. They decided my efforts to solo climb up to Diamond wasnt worth giving me anything, so i got Plat 1 placement for S7 the next season, didnt get anything i should have. Fast forward to i think season 17 or something? Anyways, i got MASTERS! I got the badge and everything, and shortly after that, they released ***cross-progression*** WOOOO!!! CELEBRATIONS ALL AROUND AMIRIGHT?! Nah, they decided to only give me my badges for my console account when Ive played more hours on my PC account in the first place, AND have played my PC for Apex overall just longer than i used the console, that account was non-active for years. The worst part about it all, was that i now own not a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• hair of proof that i got to masters or any of that other than the holo-spray they let me keep for some reason.. Took everything else. Give me my stuff back RESPAWN! Every time i get on the game, I'm reminded that everything i worked for (over 2000 hrs on this game) was yoinked from me bc y'all somehow cant get cross-prog right.. when games have been able to do it correctly since the early 2000's. I personally wouldn't recommend this game becuase that would inherently be recommending someone to willingly waste their time for some Developers who dont give enough of a damn to even do something as simple as cross-prog correctly for the audience.

I can't figure how EA, a company holding millions and millions of undeserved dollars in their nasty ass pockets can hire such idiots as a ""developing team"" and think it'll go well. Ok, They made Titanfall and it's amazing but HOW ON EARTH is it possible for these guys to do a such ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• game. They created the holy grail of movement shooters (Titanfall) and then they do something worse than Satan's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• foreskin that has been dipped multiple times in rotten diarrhea and they DARE call it a game. I mean the concept and the lore is really cool but at this point, these are really the only good points to this game so just make it a TV series fr. Here's a list of the things I LOVE about Apex Legends:
- The porn
Here's a list of the things I HATE about Apex Legends:
- The matchmaking
- The 20 tick servers (in 2024, are yall serious?!)
- Getting shot through walls
- Not being able to hear Conduits, Horizons and basically anyone who walks up to me
- Hearing my teammate's footsteps
- The devs that don't listen to their community
- Broken Moon
- Revenant
- Aim assist
- Scripts that are supposed to be illegal but in reality, the devs don't do ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• abt it
- The anticheat that's more blind than Helen Keller
- Conduit
- The matchmaking
- Getting kicked out of the game because the servers suck and then getting timed out for 10 minutes because I ""abandoned early""
- The whole dev team
- The matchmaking
- Aim assist
No but on a serious note, if, for some black magic ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ery, the devs sees this, I have some genuine propositions to make this game better. If yall invest in the game, it's playerbase WILL grow and then you'll make more money. So here's what yall can do and I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT HARD TO DO:
- Fix the matchmaking: put people with a similar account level (about 200 or 300 levels difference), a similar lifetime KD/R (about 0.5 to 0.8 kd difference) and a similar KD/R during the last 2 or 3 seasons (something like 0.8 to 1.2 kd difference or even less). Then, in ranked, YOU PUT THE SAME RANKS TOGETHER, but you take in consideration their highest ranks of the last 3 seasons and you try to make them similar (you add the mmr of the 3 ranks and try to have a similar result for eveyone in the lobby). Then, if they party up, you just add all the values of each criterion and find similar parties WITH the other matchmaking method I just mentionned.
- Fix the servers: You guys have the budget to have better than 20 tick servers. Even Roblox does better. At least, give us some 60 tick servers or even more (if you are generous enough)
- Fix the anticheat: I mean, just put one in place. It's literally doing nothing rn. The anticheat team is legit living the dream, they're paid to do nothing. It would be a good idea to get a lot of the cheaters banned, right??? Right???
- Nerf aim assist: 0.4!? 0.4 is crazy ngl. At this point, the game is aiming for you. Just lower it down to 0.2 and give controller players the ability to move while looting deathboxes so they won't cry about it. This and like superjumps or 90 degrees tap strafes so it's still fair (kinda).
The only reason why I still play is because it's the only decent (even decent is a generous term) movement shooter I could find and there's no game similar to Driveclub to go play instead. So please, Respawn Entertainement, give me more reasons to me and the majority of your playerbase to play your game.",False

If I was cheating I think i'd atleast be able to get over 400 damage in a battle royale... then maybe i could be the one crouching furiously over recent kills. EA.. you can stuff it. You should be able to spot cheaters no problem with all the data im sure you're collecting.... but instead you cast a ridiculously wide net to makeup for your laziness.

CONS-----
**It says 30 ping? It really means over 200.
**Server issues.
**No audio.
**Missing money/Coins.
**Price gouging.
**The SBMM has been broken sense season 12/13 (since 2022) and they wont revert it back.
**Gambling enthusiasts.
**Missing Loot.
**MANY Cheaters that the CEO doesn't care to get rid of.
**(If you're a Lore buff) A constant change of lore, character development, characters, and stealing of character traits to add to new characters which makes no sense.
**Our once Legendary Items customized for Individual Legends has been taken away. Now we have random Mythical Items that also makes no sense.
**Badges make no sense.
**If you lose an item? EA/Help desk wont give it back, or look into it. I myself lost 500 coins and a loot box from Shadow Society and have not been compensated individually for this.
**The sheer disregard for the general population and Favoritism towards the Pro Players.
**NERFING good Legends for NO REASON.
**TOXIC players that excuse their behavior even though its a TEAM BASED GAME. It was not like this in the beginning of Apex, but now its a trend.

--PROS
** Movement
** Gun play
** Legends are fun to play
** The best audio you will NEVER get a chance to hear
** Some of the most amazing artist of skins that are being abused, with AI.

5915,2024-05-09,649.7,"I genuinely cannot recommend this game in good faith.
Yes, I have 650 hours played. Yes, I'm going to continue to play it, because friends of mine play and I want to play with them. But I will not encourage anyone to try this game new.
I like to think Respawn themselves have a good track record of trying to be good to the players. But EA chokes them out with pricing and forcing them to focus more on producing even more content that bleeds your money dry. A new currency was recently implemented for a cosmetic weapon you can't even get without spending boatloads of money on it. So that's an additional point where you're forced to grind or spend money. Great.
Next is the poor execution of gameplay mechanics. It used to be duo or trio queues, now it's solo or trio. They specifically removed duos to implement solos, and that absolutely boggles my mind. I play duos 999/1000 games, so now I'm effectively screwed for the entire season. Like sure I can play solos if my friend is gone, but suffering through trios with either just a team of two trying our best, or with a random player is just not fun.
But that's all talking about this season. Let's talk about why I, in general, cannot endorse this game.

-Absolutely no MMR. If you jump into the regular battle royale, you could get pitted against either absolute beginners who just got out of their bot matches (yes, the game starts you off with 3 bot matches, which are also incredibly dumb and don't represent actual gameplay), or it will put you in against someone who has prestiged 3 times over, is diamond or higher in ranked, and has clocked in 5,000 hours. Nothing beats getting sniped when you barely showed a pixel of your body out of cover. It's a frustrating experience.

-Game geometry can just screw you at random moments. Portions of the map which may either seem climbable, or are climbable, may just randomly drop you off. Or they'll not register you're climbing in the first place. Doors will hold for your enemy when you go to kick the door handle, but when you try to hold the doors they open backwards for the enemy no problem.

-Netcode is really poor. I've had instances where I get a clear meatshot on an opponent, the hitsound registers, but no damage is actually registered. Or I go down despite being fully behind cover after being shot by someone who was around the other side.

-It has the classic battle royale problem of ""you can just get screwed when you drop"". Half the time I drop there are no nearby guns, or a pistol, but my opponent has a shotgun or LMG and just gets to mow me down while I have nothing. And it doesn't feel good when I get that end of the stick instead and my opponent is defenseless. It's a lame situation and sucks to deal with.

There's a lot more, but that's all I want to compress this into right now. Please do not give EA your money.",False

I play 2 games. League of Legends and Apex Legends and I really cant decide which game is more bugged (should be really insulting for the Apex devs). I rather pay 50 euros each and have a decent working game than 2 free to play games that get more bugged with every patch.

Yesterday for example the game crashed twice in 5 minutes. Really cool. Since the new season (21) the sound is bugged in the sense that I have sound for few seconds, then I dont for a few seconds and on. Besides the sound instead of 10 fps in the lobby and first 30 seconds ingame, I now have like 5 and it doesnt even load every frame on the screen even tho just the maps changed and the backround in the lobby.
I admit my PC isnt the best but I can run the game, when I'm ingame but thats really the biggest barrier to get ingame and be ingame for more than 2 min without crashing.

Besides the bugs I can just critize one thing: Fuse, that is the most re... most unfun champ to play against and it makes no sense for me to nerf different things like champs or weapons but not this champ.

Do I recommend it? For ppl with NASA PC's yes, everyone else no. Just play some browser games and you have more fun and waste less time.",False

Picked the game back up for the first time since it dropped in 2019, and the boys and I have been playing since Season 19, now Season 21. Right as they finally start picking things up and giving more meaningful updates like re-spawning with your weapons, character leveling choices, and a universal heirloom; then, they decide to drop Duos from their game mode selection in favor of Solos. I'm just one of many players who enjoys the 'battle buddy' experience, and Trios is usually fine if everyone is online, but we just can't help getting frustrated at randoms. So when its just me and one of my friends online, Apex is just unplayable, on account of the sheer frustration of dealing with a new random every single match with no way to learn how to actually cooperate with them before the match's end. The game is still awesome, and we're still going to keep playing once everyone is finally on at the same time, but 'bold' decisions like these are a terrible business practice. EA needs to start hosting polls when it comes to decisions that divide their community like this, or the gambles they make with these decisions are going to draw the last straw some day soon.

The only reason I play this game is because I mostly have a great time with a friend.

So, you'd say that I'd recommend this game, right? I would if EA / Respawn Entertainment would listen to their community instead of making the game worse with every single update.

I have no idea why they can't manage to keep solos, duos and trios available forever. Unbeliveable that they have disabled duos for approximately 6 weeks because of the latest season that got released like a day before this review. If you can't find a third partner, you're forced to play with a random player, which is fair enough, but this sucks as well due to the voice optimization. It's really hard to communicate with a random player and based on my experience only a few will actually cooperate instead of minding their own business and leaving the match as soon as they get killed.

I'm also not a big fan of the latest maps, but it's not something that I hate. They just don't look nice in my opinion.
I wish you could always choose between maps you like, (e.g. CS2, TF2 etc.)

What I also hate is the fact that they cancelled an event called ""Winter Express"" during the last winter holiday because they apparently had released an update not so long ago and because of balancing problems, which could have been easily fixed if they simply removed characters that might have been too OP.

Long story short: This game can be fun, just don't expect to master this game quickly. I'm still not an excellent player. Be aware that EA won't do anything that pleases their community.",False

Also, while it gives you teammates that barely know how to run/fire a weapon, you are put against tripple stacked opponents even in public games. When you play with a friend and 1 random, every opponent have 10x in game experience that you 3 have combined, like 30k kills on a character while you have 3k kills in total.

I like the game play. It is challenging if trying to solo. Its best to be on a team to help take down other players. The nice thing is you don't need a MIC to talk to other team mates, for they have this call out button for objects and enemies. I'd still prefer a team with MIC player. This game takes more strategy then just pray and spray. You essentially use a full mag just to break shields and another to down a person. That's why team mates are nice. Now For some reason the PC players are way better then console players. I've noticed at least one every game there's a squad or one guy that just whips the whole lobby.

6499,2024-05-07,35.9,"I just came back to this game after four years of not playing it and I was surprised to not only find it in a good state but also a state I still recognize. The game hasn't spiraled out of control and the freebies you get to earn are still quite accessible. Would recommend if you're a fan of battle royale* shooters with good mobility and a very charming, diverse cast of characters!

Do keep in mind that the game is a Battle Royale however, and if you don't enjoy losing the majority of the time then this game probably isn't for you! It's a great game with great gunplay and general gameplay, but it's not like a PvP game that tries to have everything be as fair as it could be. Most of the time you're going to just get unlucky and run into people that happened to get better loot, a better position, and may just be better than you in general.

It's a game that in my opinion you need to play because you enjoy it, not to win. But if that appeals to you, or if you already like battle royales? I highly recommend this one.",True

6715,2024-05-06,21.9,"As one of the most anticipated releases in the gaming world, Apex Legends has undoubtedly left its mark on the battle royale genre. Developed by Respawn Entertainment, the creators of the critically acclaimed Titanfall series, Apex Legends delivers a fresh and exhilarating take on the ever-popular multiplayer format.

From the moment you drop onto the vibrant landscape of Kings Canyon, it's evident that Apex Legends is more than just another battle royale clone. The game's standout feature is its unique roster of Legends, each with their own distinct personalities, abilities, and playstyles. Whether you're a cunning strategist like Bloodhound, a nimble scout like Pathfinder, or a ruthless assassin like Wraith, there's a Legend to suit every player's preferences.

The gameplay mechanics of Apex Legends are finely tuned, offering a seamless fusion of fast-paced action and strategic teamwork. The introduction of the innovative ping system revolutionizes communication in multiplayer gaming, allowing players to convey vital information to their teammates with ease. Whether you're marking enemy locations, highlighting loot, or suggesting a tactical retreat, the ping system fosters teamwork and coordination in a way that few other games have achieved.

Another standout aspect of Apex Legends is its fluid movement system, inherited from the Titanfall series. From sliding down hills to wall-running across buildings, traversing the map feels incredibly smooth and satisfying. The addition of ziplines and launch balloons further enhances the sense of mobility, giving players the freedom to explore every inch of Kings Canyon in search of victory.

In terms of visuals and audio design, Apex Legends excels on all fronts. The game's vibrant art style brings Kings Canyon to life with its lush landscapes, futuristic architecture, and dynamic weather effects. Meanwhile, the sound design immerses players in the heat of battle, from the thunderous roar of gunfire to the distant echoes of approaching footsteps.

While Apex Legends has garnered widespread acclaim since its release, it's not without its flaws. Some players have raised concerns about the game's monetization model, particularly the reliance on loot boxes and microtransactions to unlock cosmetic items. Additionally, the occasional server issues and balancing issues can detract from the overall experience, though Respawn Entertainment has been proactive in addressing these issues through regular updates and patches.

In conclusion, Apex Legends stands as a testament to Respawn Entertainment's creativity and innovation in the competitive gaming landscape. With its diverse roster of Legends, intuitive gameplay mechanics, and stunning visuals, it's no surprise that Apex Legends has become a cultural phenomenon in the world of gaming. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the battle royale genre, Apex Legends offers an experience that is as exhilarating as it is unforgettable.",True

1. Movement is great, matchmaking sucks.
The movement potential for this game (especially for PC players) is absolutely wonderful and definitely sets Apex apart from other FPS games. However, this also means there's an extremely high skill ceiling.

Matchmaking is pretty much a mess for anyone playing more than 5 hours a week. Ranked and pubs will have new players facing off against esports pros/streamers at this point.

Like most games, aside from encountering the occasional hacker, there will be toxic elements in them. However, at least some form of action is taken against these toxic individuals in games like CSGO2. But not in Apex, especially when they use the in-game mic.
This has been an ongoing issue for years, but EA and Respawn have done absolutely nothing to address it. They preach about keeping the community a safer place and taking a stand against toxicity, but their actions speak otherwise.

1. Reporting players for toxicity only works IF they text to communicate. (In-game mic reports are ignored unless you actually record your games and send them footage of it via support email.)

2. Unlike what EA preaches, the in-game taunts for legends are anything but friendly.

3. The report functions for players who sabotage the game is just for show. Don‚Äôt expect any action to be taken against them. For example, trolls who loot your desired attachments, throw them off the map, and intentionally body-block your bullets in a fight.

At the very least in OCE servers all players in casual feel like they are sweating for their lives to win the match, this isn't entirely bad for older players but for newer players who drop in after their initial first matches are getting put up against these players which causes them to slowly stop playing. Along with the fact that their is always a constant in the same 3-6 legends in every match making many of the less popular legends even less popular making any purchases and time put into them feel worthless.
The servers always feel like they are having issues in just about all matches you'll for no reason either get no audio cues of players running around the location you are in, having your power just straight up either not activate (Mirage trying to place a decoy whilst standing/walking over a tiny rock) and having hits just fail to register for no reason whatsoever.
However the worst problem is from the teams clear disregard about the state of their game and more of an interest in pushing collection events and skins to get as much money as they can out of their playerbase.
Until they actually start addressing problems with this game I can never recommend this game that used to be to me and many others the best Battle Royale experience on the market.

Overall really good game! The mechanics are solid, there are a lot of different possible loadouts and different abilities with all the characters so no two playstyles are identical.
The abilities themselves are unique and fun, the only shortcoming is that certain legends definitely outshine others, lowering the incentive for certain legends to be played, whilst simultaneously making it hard to play without certain legends, namely Lifeline.
But other than that I enjoy the game! There is always something to do, whether its challenges or collecting skins, lots of fun to be had!",True

Review:

Apex Legends isn't just another entry into the crowded battle royale genre; it's a revelation. Respawn Entertainment has crafted a game that not only meets but exceeds expectations in nearly every aspect. From its fluid movement mechanics to its diverse cast of characters, Apex Legends stands tall as a masterpiece of the genre.

One of the first things that strikes you about Apex Legends is its impeccable gunplay. Weapons feel weighty and impactful, with each gun offering a distinct feel and playstyle. Whether you prefer the precision of a sniper rifle or the close-quarters chaos of a shotgun, there's a weapon for every situation. And with the addition of attachments and weapon mods, the depth of customization adds another layer of strategy to each firefight.

But what truly sets Apex Legends apart is its Legends - unique characters with their own personalities, abilities, and backstories. From the agile Wraith to the defensive Gibraltar, each Legend brings something special to the table. Mastering the abilities of your chosen Legend and synergizing with your teammates is key to success, adding a level of depth and teamwork rarely seen in other battle royale games.

The game's map, Kings Canyon (later joined by new maps), is a marvel of design, offering a variety of landscapes and environments to explore. From sprawling urban areas to lush wilderness, every location feels distinct and memorable. And with regular updates and map changes, there's always something new to discover.

But perhaps Apex Legends' greatest achievement is its commitment to player satisfaction. With regular balance patches, bug fixes, and content updates, Respawn Entertainment has shown a dedication to listening to its community and evolving the game based on player feedback. Events, challenges, and seasonal updates keep the experience fresh and engaging, ensuring that players always have a reason to return to the arena.

In conclusion, Apex Legends isn't just a game; it's a revolution. With its polished gameplay, diverse cast of characters, and commitment to player satisfaction, it sets a new standard for what a battle royale experience can be. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or new to the genre, Apex Legends offers something for everyone and is a must-play for any fan of competitive gaming.",True

I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you retire. You had a rough childhood, but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the court, you're a great husband and father, sometimes I even call you dad. I forvever dread and weep, thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my own life it were the only thing that could put a smile on your beautiful face. You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you first left clevenland and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell from my right eye when I watched you win your first ring in miami, because deep down, my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then allas, you did, my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced. 2015 was a hard year for us baby, but in 2016 you made history happen. You came back from 3-1 and I couldn't believe it. I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my glorious king exclaim these words, ""CLEVELAND, THIS IS FOR YOU!""

7579,2024-04-27,845.5,"To be honest, I never liked the battle royale concept (or, I was never interested in this type of games) but I changed my mind.

Let's take step by step:

1) Trio mode and Duo mode: It's very fun. You can play as solo if you want it to be more challenging. This is the mode I most usually play as solo queue. Of course, sometimes teammates go to crazy places but other times they go to better and safer places. It is not bad to go to the hot areas sometimes and try to win there. It only makes you good. When looting, don't go all together to the same place because one person will get everything and others won't. Separate yourselves when looting but keeping yourselves together in the same area.

3) Solo mode: Sweaty. Very sweaty, but fun. It should stay forever in the game because a lot of players like to play solo and it's a good way to practice. The good thing is, if you die, you have another chance.

4) Quad mode: Never played it with a full squad of friends, but as a solo queue player it's just a pain, in my experience. Teammates always land where everyone lands and everyone fights to get a weapon and everyone end up dying in like 30 seconds. One interesting thing is, if you end up dying and if your teammate respawns you, you end up with all your weapon attachments. This don't happen in Trio or Duo.

5) Arenas: never played it so idk. Right now, it's not in the game btw.


Right now, the mode available are Trios and Quads (late July, 2024) .


Mixtape (Gun Run, Team Deathmatch, Control, Lockdown):
Gun Run: You get one gun. Once you get a kill, you get a different weapon. Wins the team who reaches the knives and get a kill. For me, that's probably the worst mode of mixtape. I always try to avoid it.

Team Deathmatch: First team to get 50 kills wins. The best mode of mixtape imo.

Lockdown: Your team must secure an area for more than one minute. If you secure you get points. You also get points for every kill. First team to reach 500 points, wins.

Control: There's 3 areas on the map your team has to control. You get points by controlling an area. Once you reach 100%, you win. Teams of 9v9. You don't have much the problem you have in Lockdown.


What I didn't like about other games of this genre was that there were quite toxic people always commenting on your plays or how bad you were. I'm not saying it doesn't happen here. But I always turn off the audio so I don't hear what my teammates are saying. Many of the games I played, few spoke and few wrote in chat.

If I give up on a game, let it be for myself. I don't want to give up a game I like because someone decided to be toxic and bully. So, that's why I started to turn off audio and everything else. True solo queue experience.",True

What isn't that great however is the fact, that since I started playing the game around 2021, I have encountered countless performance and server issues. This might be overlooked at the beginning but eventually they get frustrating as hell, especially when they do not get fixed at all.

One of my friends had issues with the game crashing randomly, while it didn't happen for the rest of us.
Then there were issues with friends just not joining into the game and remaining in the lobby while the game starts for the other two.
I have recurring issues with Package loss which apparently has something to do with Telekom and EA, and it just never gets resolved. Now since recently I have the issue that my game just closes completely without error message at seemingly random times.

7643,2024-04-26,159.6,"Apex has a refreshing take to the battle royale fps genre. The game has a very high skill ceiling, a variety of unique characters, and incredible gun play. Apex Legends really nailed movement, I've spent plenty of hours in an offline server doing jumps and glides.

Gun play is fun, diverse, and rewarding. There are so many strategies to play. You can play fast and close with an R-99 and a Peacekeeper, you can play slow and methodical with the R-301, or even play marksman weapons like the 30-30. Resource management and taking smart fights matter more than individual weapons as there are many viable weapon choices. Even ""low tier"" weapons like the Mozambique can dish out a world of hurt and get you out of a pinch if needed.

Apex makes looting very rewarding. Every weapon has slots to upgrade - from optics to barrel stabilizers to stocks. Cosmetics are also very good looking in Apex. I have quite a few nice skins for my weapons and legends. Unfortunately, Heirlooms (melee cosmetics) are quite expensive and hard to come by. I have easily spent $300 for just two Heirlooms on my favorite legends. While they are not required and only serve a cosmetic value, I wish it wasn't so expensive. Speaking of that, Apex has a loot box system called Apex packs. Luckily, they are given out often and for free, though you can purchase them at a rate of about $1 each.

Legends are unique with lots of lore, voice line interactions, and big personalities. Abilities are unique and augment gunplay. There are intel characters like Seer, support characters like Gibralter, and sweaty mantle-super-gliding bald wraiths with a peacekeeper to suit all playstyles.

There are a few negatives to Apex. Like all modern competitive multiplayer games, the game is plagued by cheaters. Surprisingly, cheating seems to be on the decline right now which is good but it is still frustrating when a cheater kills half the lobby with a charge rifle while midair. I also dislike the ranking system because it rewards ratting. Because the system prefers placements over kills, there are a lot of ratting players just hiding for points instead of playing the game.

Despite those negatives, I think Apex Legends is still a great game to play and the premier choice for battle royales. I highly recommend Apex Legends for anyone in the market for a fun and dynamic FPS game!",True

PLAYERS?!? I hope they don't see me. Go out of my way to hide and plan a different route towards safety. 2 Squads left. I'm watching them fight from a far. I creep closer. THIS IS MY TIME TO SHINE! I will strike when they loot. I whip out my kraber. I fire oneshot. I missed! DESYNC! I reposition getting ready for the next offensive. This is where all those hours in kovak is gonna pay off. I aim my incredibly powerful 50 caliber sniper rifle once more. I miss. GO AGAIN! I miss. I get lasered by 2 R301's at max distance and place second. DAMN!

Seems like a pretty cut and dry shooter that has a store that contains both overpriced crap and loot boxes. If a standard shooter is what you want I would still look elsewhere, the game play is lacking and promotes the same pay to play model that Rainbow Siege uses. It should also be noted that the game developers or publishers are very political and very vocal about it.

Thank you EA for making me realize that this game is the main reason that Battle Royale is basically a dead genre now because of all transactions you decided to add.

Allow me to give a brief explanation....

Back its former glory days, the matchmaking was fairly balanced, KD actually meant something when it came to who should be in a certain lobby, and who should not. Now, KD means nothing, ""skill-based"" matchmaking doesn't work, the servers nearly run rampant with hackers, and every game you play you'll be thrown into a server with either smurfs or way-to-high-a-skill player (or both), and you'll rage and punch a whole through your monitor.

8109,2024-04-22,1604.8,"I have played titanfall 1 and 2, I started playing apex on day 1 excited by the prospect that the titanfall universe is expanding.

I kept going with that idea for 4 years without doubting respawn at all because I did infact enjoy every story element they implemented in the universe. I was so hopeful that I even managed to be good at the game to the point of matchmaking specifically putting me with ranked masters. (to those who care I didn't play ranked at all I just kept tabs on my K/D since season 4 specifically because the first 3 seasons had broken disruptor rounds, broken flatline and devotion, it started at 1.03 and in season 17 it firmly stayed on 1.50s)

When season 11 came out with Ash that was my golden period. I am a massive fan of Ash and simply by playing her exclusively I prided myself on being top 0.05% in kills on Ash according to Apex Status. It was a nice time. Then slowly but surely, my happiness was wearing out. Respawn started to take WAY too long with good stories with good gamemodes and zero things to be hyped about. Like they literally started to make the game worse and worse bit by bit. And frankly I have to say, Conduit was the final nail in the coffin, they said it themselves that legend abilities are worth 10-15% of the fight and the rest was the guns, clearly not with this character. I genuinely quit a week in that season.

One day I'm going to release a fanmade project video that will make me happy about the titanfall and apex universe once again. I'm just sad that it's going to be fueled by spite for Respawn's lack to fleshout their amazing universe.",False

1- A game cribbled with bugs all around (even the menu).
2- Aimbot and aim assist and no recoil is legal here, no problem with that if you are a mouse/keyboard lover then get lost, you are not invited to the party.
3- Dynamic FPS where you can slide and climb walls allowing you to break the laws of physics at the same time (this is a feature here, definitely not some mis-development).
4- You can play with people all around the world, this is positive except people can now shoot you through walls thanks to ping feature thus breaking space and time (notice the sarcasm here).
5- A game suffering from a lack of novelty (to be honest, like any Battle Royale format).
6- A great character design (I am definitely not thinking of Bangalore instant noodle hairs, download the game for more, I will let you savour the other gold nuggets of laugh. Please note, this is better shared with friends).
7- An inclusive game where your character can be handicapped by sound bugs (or perhaps another innovative feature? Ear drum rupture perhaps?) Silent grenades (certainly explained because it is futuristic grenades), Fridge size ninja characters with lighter footsteps than a winter rabbit sprinting on snow (this is logical if you think hard of it, these characters are well trained, do not attempt this home), caliber .5 sniper than can also be fully silent (future is now old man, adapt!)
8- Free to Play! (Hopefully seeing the list above). However you can buy skins which, taking into account the previous point, allow you to battle your friends for the ugliest skin, have fun! (get your credit card out once you sold your house though, otherwise, you are just to poor)
9- A game that is only buoyant due to the lack of serious competitor for fast FPS (Old Gen Unreal, please come back, I miss you so much!)

I would personally recommend this game if you want to make other games more tasteful, as a tool for contrast. Download this software (yes I said it) at your own peril! You will have fun realising what poor development is and how conflictual development and marketing can be.

I personally played 100 hours with aim assist off and after that i would honestly say i would rather reduce/remove aim assist to get my movement back.

8258,2024-04-20,318.9,"WOULD NOT recommend.
1. Game is full of bugs
2. Game is not balanced at all, you will NEVER play against people with similar skill levels or hours, the MM system is utterly broken and they have no clue how to fix it, 20 seasons they just cannot fix it.
3. People spamming n word in voice chat, but if you type back something like ""st*u id*ot"" you get 1week-perm bans, nothing ever happens to them even with proof sent to EA support.
4. EA SUPPORT, need I say more?
5. Anticheat is trash, free version of easy anti cheat that is only good for show, kids can bypass this anti-cheat version.
6. CONTROLLERS in PC LOBBIES, they have 60% aim assist and non-existent recoil.
7. SCRIPTS/MACROS rampant.
8. Teammates are always vegetables if you solo queue, but you only play vs trio stacked diamond/master/predators with thousands of hours at the very minimum.
9. Pubs are unplayable, for the same reason MM isn't playable either, they add SBMM to it so if you get 1 good game enjoy playing vs twitch tv sweats using 90 movement mechanics on you.
10. THIRD PARTIES, this game is horrible in that regards, you can hear and see when people are fighting across the map.
11. CHEATERS, so many cheaters, not only is the anticheat trash, but the server-side detection of cheats is nonexistent too, yes, you can just hack and rage hack all day without repercussions in this game, there's not even a simple detection of someone spraying from across the map 30 bullets all hitting i nthe center of your head with 0% failed shots, it feels like old fps games when there was no anticheat.
12. Microtransactions, the skins are HORRIBLE, they want 40-360$ for a slightly colored item, enjoy paying for lootboxes for A SLIGHT CHANCE that u might get a heirloom (super rare), I guess battlepasses are ok, you can buy once and if you grind each season to lvl 90 you basically get the money back to buy the next one, but outside a few gamba boxes and credits and maybe 1 cool animation if youre lucky, the skins are always super ugly and the last 2 super good skins always have trash animations that remove 90% of your screen when you use them, iron sights are also terrible and a lot of skins are p2w.
13. Servers, they can be ddosed, and that's the best thing it can happen to them, there are much worse problems, sometimes you'd have to restart the game because you're just sliding while standing still, bugs being reintroduced over and over and over and over again since season 1 to 20 in over 6 years since the game launched, they nerf guns then buff them back up, then nerf them again, and so on, actual good game mechanics they take away and leave only trash ones.
14. Respawn studios are TERRIBLE, I hope EA does ""the usual"" with this studio once Apex is just not milkable anymore because people wake up and say enough is enough.
EDIT: 15. Enjoy having NO AUDIO, the devs basically added a bloody icon to indicate when u can't hear audio AHAHAHHA they can't even fix the audio of the game, basically you will almost never hear footsteps of someone approaching you even if they full run all the way, if you are shooting or causing noises yourself, and no, it's not by design, the game litearlly just decides you don't need to hear those footsteps, a MAJOR issue that has been plaguing since release, they DONT CARE. they only care about your money, never give them a penny.

Overall the game is just terribly bad, yes you can tapstrafe neostrafe and do cool wallbounces and grapplings, superslides superglides and so on - they do have nice mechanics in it, one clips are super satisfying, one of the best game on the market, but there's a thing called ""EA"" and ""RESPAWN STUDIOS"" which are utterly holding this back that makes this game go from a potential A+++++++ to a max of C+, they don't care, they just want 360$ for god awful DEATH BOXES, imagine PAYING FOR A DEATH BOX SKIN.

All events are mega recolor trash, with modes that nobody plays outside the super casuals that boot the game every time a new event is on and then never touch again until the next one.

Rather install fortnite and start playing that instead of this trash, doesn't even have a re-queue button, you just keep bouncing back and forth between waiting times, they can't code a stupid re-queue button, everything is spaghetti from their game to their back-end trash PHP ""code"".",False
8259,2024-04-20,2923.7,"Apex is probably the most frustrating game to be a fan of. The gameplay is genuinely good, the movement in general to the gunplay to the weird quirks of the engine all make this game very unique for an fps and battle royale. Unfortunately it is run by one of, if not the worst companies in modern gaming. The servers are terrible, there is little to no cheat prevention, their level of greed is INSANE in terms of item pricing and the amount of collection events, and their matchmaking system: jesus christ, where do I begin. EA literally has a patent for their matchmaking system called ""engagement optimized matchmaking"", which is as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and predatory as it sounds. Don't play for a few days -> come back, get a lobby full of noobs that I destroy, next game I'm up against master/pred stacks. The game just rarely feels fair. It doesn't feel good to beat people who barely know what they're doing and it doesn't feel good to get crushed by people sweating their asses off.
At this point I should have a masters in education because of how often I get teammates who have only played a handful of games and I have to teach them how to play. Not to mention the matches where my teammates are *actual* bots and drop solo only to punch a wall until they die in order to sell accounts for cheaters to play ranked on. And then, once every few hours, I get a match that's actually fun where I get a teammate of similar skill and the fights are fair. Then the cycle repeats. Please do not play this trash game.",False

Ever feel like you're trapped on a hamster wheel powered by Red Bull and existential dread? Then boy, howdy, has Apex Legends got the game mode for you! This frenetic battle royale throws you into a colorful, fast-paced world where the only thing slower than the TTKs (time to kills) is the respawn queue.

Legends? More Like A.D.D. All-Stars!

Look, I appreciate a good hero shooter, but in Apex, everyone seems afflicted by a severe case of gotta-go-fast-itis. Wraith? Phasing through reality like a discount David Copperfield. Octane? Stimming himself into oblivion like a hummingbird with a death wish. These folks make Sonic the Hedgehog look like a rocking chair enthusiast.

Loot Here, Loot There, Loot EVERYWHERE (But Good Luck Finding a Gun)

Speaking of fast, have you ever tried assembling furniture while hopped up on Pixy Stix? That's what looting feels like in Apex. You'll be sprinting from building to building, desperately searching for a decent weapon amidst a sea of mobile phone chargers and sniper scopes. Just remember, that shiny gold backpack you finally snagged? It probably weighs more than your self-esteem after getting sniped from across the map for the tenth time.

So, Should You Play Apex Legends?

If you enjoy feeling like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar crash, or if you have the reflexes of a retired Navy SEAL, then Apex Legends might be your jam. But for the rest of us who like our shooters a little more tactical and a lot less frantic, this might be a hard pass. Maybe try tiddlywinks instead.

Wanted to recover all the things I unlocked on XBox live and transfer to steam, but to recover that account I have to remember the last thing I bought (Date and amount) that would have been over 3 years ago.
On top of that, the servers are the laggiest I've dealt with on a FPS. Did you walk around the corner and out of sight? maybe on your screen, but in the server you're about 10 steps behind that.
Grenades are how you start every fight. If you're not carrying 5 at all times then you're at a disadvantage.
Hit boxes are janky at best. You can watch a kill cam of a shot clearly missing you, but it registers as hitting you.
If you're not playing on console then you're automatically at a disadvantage. Console players get a soft auto aim, while keyboard and mouse is left to actually be good at the game.
They also took away Arenas, which was how my friends and I enjoyed playing the game the most.

Since Season 11, the game's temple has been completely changed. potato server, xim, aim assist, brainless characters, cheaters, ugly skins and ornaments, the same game mode, file editing, and you can just tap strafe and spin twice in the air once you jump. Even in a TDM match with 6 teams, 18 players, u can find out at least 6 controllers, which completely destroys the balance of the game.
I don‚Äôt know ppl who needs aim assist has a physical disability or a cerebellar defect. Need a controller and the system to help you aim and win the game to gain a sense of superiority. In short, I would call him a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Ppl who play MnK are all clowns. Just forget about all aiming skills, press the aim button, and the system will automatically move the perspective for you. In this way, I would rather play this game on device.

The game is a waste. It is a battle royal made by money-hungry bigots. Basically, when you play a battle royal you are not looking for a character story you don not care about. You want an avatar that holds a gun and shoots when you click your mouse button. But the game really tries to force-feed you its characters who are not interesting nor edgy(in a good way) so that you buy their skins through microtransactions. They are all over the top and cringe and make you feel pain every time your character talks or if you mute them every time you see them in the pick phase.



And yet, it is not the most shameful and lame thing about it, they try to poke into peoples' third world nationalistic spirit, -which I believe is almost non-existent nowadays- to get into the characters that represent nothing good about any nationality. There are people of color with overexerted features same as an Indian, an English woman who is portrayed as a mad lunatic and so on, to the point that it is just simply racist.



I said the game is a waste because all the effort and graphics and gameplay design is just serving the purpose of tricking you into spending money on the game. I hope no one falls for their dumb racist and vomit-inducing scheme and the game gets abandoned completely.",False

Considering the money they make they should have just re-create the whole audio from scratch if they can't fix it.
Game is rigged to team you up with noobs after you previously won a match or you don't get a 2nd team mate- this has never not happened since season 20.
The majority of players on the EU servers are russians that scream in voice and do not play as a team, the rest are french that do no communicate in English or pings.
Worlds Edge is unplayable- you need to drop remote or else you'll just get 3rd, 4th, 5th party depending on the drop point.
Olympus is not even decent, annoying with too much open space
Storm Point is ok.

- solid gun play
- mostly well balanced weapons
- movement and all the mechanics to it
- finally banned inhuman configs (Steam configs still exist though)

contras:
- same maps for the past 2 years
- build in 40% perfect aimbot for controller players
- unstable 20hz servers (Among Us has a higher tickrate)
- broken sbmm
- useless anticheat (people that say swearwords are more likely to get banned)
- only real content being released are recolors of skins
- major bugs every update (Respawn keeps firing playtesters)
- audio issues (missing footsteps)
- upcoming cosmetics will likely be more 500 $ deathboxes + ugly universal heirlooms (no one asked for it)
- unstable servers
- performance issues get worse every update


overall maybe worth playing casually, IF one can ignore all those problems the game has
Respawn doesnt really give a crap about this game unless people manage to get free stuff from a bug

Game really fell off with the quality and the company respect for players who play their game. Been playing since season 4 Assimilation, back when EA allowed the Respawn devs to put their heart and soul into the game they made Apex a gaming experience that rivaled all the BR's of it's time. Now EA is dead set on sucking every penny out of the remaining player's pockets who still ply their game. They allow leakers to ""spoil"" their upcoming updates and game changes and so nothing about it. It really takes the fun of new content out of the game when the whole community knows what game modes and skins will be in the game the next month of playing the game. In season 4 it was really innovative of them to have a whole character(Forge) ready to be shipped out in the game files with abilities and everything ready to go. Then to release a trailer that killed off the new legend and who is being replaced with a robot assassin. Anyway, EA and Respawn needs to go out of their comfort zone and make content that is innovative instead of using the same formula over and over again. Which is something they won't do. Please change EA...",False

8810,2024-04-14,372.8,"I've got about 230-240 days(5500-5800 hours) between all platforms and all I gotta say is, if you like to grind and shoot things going at the speed of light 20% of the time then this is great. I have played since the first week but kinda fell off a few times to play other games like fortnite, cod, or some story games. This is because apex has a very off-putting feel to it when things don't change between seasons...why? I have no idea, probably because our brains have gotten so rotten over time that we need content thrown in our faces or we literally die. Anyways, I'll give an actual review and stop yapping. So in the beginning, it can be an interesting experience to say the least, weapons that have a unique look and feel, unique abilities with optional ways to play with them. It can really be a love at first sight, that is if it turns out to cheat on you in the future. This is a terrible analogy but I mean apex can change in a heartbeat. Lately with all these gun changes such as SMGs having huge movement nerfs and small but game changing accuracy differences to all guns. It almost feels like the devs are making every gun worse since maybe season 7 or 8. I say that since the early seasons, most guns were pretty bad(maybe I was), just in different ways. LOOK, if you want a competitive game that doesn't need you to adjust to new things too quickly like fortnite does, then apex is awesome but in the grand scheme of things, you might be better off waiting for another game to come out that you can think about for yourself, many people have mixed feeling about apex, it's either really fun or too sweaty for people that want more casual play. I would say it's the kind of game where you just kinda turn on and off to check things out or see what's up with friends and what not. But everyone has their own opinion so I would give it a week of play before you really decide what to do with it. WOW, I suck at this(I reread my review). I hope it gives SOME closure though, idk. My personal opinion, it's very good. Should you play it? YES. Are you going to like it as a first time BR player? Most Likely. And finally, will you spend over 150 USD for a cool thing that looks cool in hands? PROBABLY (Not me though cuz I'm cool...I did actually) Thanks for reading guys!",True

Apex Legends is a game I have played for 4 years, and I have definitely seen its ups and downs as time passed. I would personally recommend this game not just because it is fun, but because it has its own unique characteristics in comparison to other Battle Royale games like COD Warzone and Fortnite. You can certainly look up many things about this game, but I believe that it is most likely guaranteed you will find a legend in the roster that suits you best. There is also a great amount of customization in this game (Which can be very expensive if you choose to spend money on this game), comparable to the likes of the games I mentioned prior, with extra possessions like your tailored banner. The last thing I will say before I review this game critically is that it may be tough for new players, though if you research ways to get better online you will get through it. Now, since we have sung its praises with many more that I did not mention, we must now look at what apex does not get right or what it could fix to do better. Hacking is currently rampant in apex, especially in the competitive mode as you move up the ranks. This has been a problem for a very long time, possibly dating back to season 2 (when I started playing), when I was on console so at that time hacking was barely a concern or even not a concern at all, while when I switched to PC in season 3, I personally started seeing cheaters in game as soon as season 5. It also relates to the large incident that happened in ALGS recently, where 2 players (Genburten and ImperialHal) had their game hijacked, giving them esp with full hitboxes, health, and player names, along with bullet (not aim-locking) aimbot. Hacking is the only concern I will describe in this review because it has been recent, and is a genuine concern and has been for a long time. In conclusion, while apex has many great qualities I mentioned, there are some concerns that do not have to do with how the game is intended to be played. I would personally give the game an 8.9/10, because despite its shortcomings, it is unique, it can be tailored, and most of all, it is great, but its shortcomings hinder me from giving it a 9/10 (Amazing). Opinions can differ widely on how good or bad this game is depending on who you ask, so I am not expecting you to 100% believe in my opinion, and all I ask of you is that you at the very least consider it.",True

Rating: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è

Apex Legends has undoubtedly solidified its place as one of the premier battle royale experiences, offering fast-paced action, dynamic gameplay mechanics, and a diverse cast of characters that keep players coming back for more. Respawn Entertainment has crafted a title that shines in many aspects, but it's not without its flaws.

First and foremost, Apex Legends excels in its gunplay and movement mechanics. The fluidity of movement, combined with the satisfying gunplay, creates an adrenaline-fueled experience that few other battle royale games can match. Whether you're sliding down a hill while peppering enemies with bullets or engaging in intense firefights across sprawling landscapes, the gameplay in Apex Legends is undeniably exhilarating.

Moreover, the inclusion of Legends, each with their own unique abilities, adds an extra layer of strategy to the game. From defensive specialists to aggressive attackers, there's a Legend to suit every playstyle. This diversity not only keeps matches feeling fresh and dynamic but also encourages teamwork and coordination among squadmates.

Visually, Apex Legends is stunning, with detailed environments and character designs that bring its vibrant world to life. The various maps offer a variety of landscapes to explore, from lush forests to urban cityscapes, each with its own distinct personality.

However, despite its many strengths, Apex Legends is not without its flaws. One of the most glaring issues is the prevalence of bugs and glitches that can occasionally disrupt gameplay. From hit registration issues to server lag, these technical hiccups can be frustrating, especially during intense firefights where split-second reactions can make all the difference.

Furthermore, while the roster of Legends is diverse and interesting, balance issues occasionally arise, with certain Legends dominating the meta while others fall by the wayside. Respawn Entertainment has done a commendable job of addressing balance concerns through regular updates and patches, but achieving perfect balance in a game with so many variables is an ongoing challenge.

Lastly, some players have voiced concerns about the game's progression system, which can feel grindy and unrewarding at times. While the addition of seasonal battle passes and limited-time events has helped to alleviate this issue to some extent, there's still room for improvement in terms of providing meaningful rewards for players' time and effort.

In conclusion, Apex Legends is a stellar battle royale experience that offers fast-paced action, dynamic gameplay mechanics, and a diverse cast of characters. While it's not without its flaws, including technical issues, balance concerns, and a somewhat grindy progression system, the overall experience is undeniably thrilling and worthy of your time. With continued support and updates from Respawn Entertainment, Apex Legends has the potential to evolve into an even greater gaming phenomenon in the years to come.",True

The core gameplay and movement is great, but for me the bit I love the most is that the variety in the different legends makes for a really high skill ceiling, and I love the aspect of mastering how to play and also play against different legends.

A lot of people complain about cosmetic issues, which I understand totally, but at the same time, you can't judge whether a game is good or not by literally just the cosmetic issues. Who cares about cosmetics when the whole point of the game is the gameplay itself.

8994,2024-04-12,166.7,"Apex fills lobbies from the top players down, meaning that anyone that performs better than a lobotomized kindergartner gets the privilege of going into diamond/pred lobbies constantly. Matchmaking is absolutely broken and serves higher tier players way better than lower tier players. It essentially aims to feed low skill players to high skill players because most people don't want to stick around long enough to get high skill.

Most cosmetics are free to try to get in a lootbox but the chances are genuinely so low of getting something you actually want that you basically end up having to spend money anyways. Legendary skins just outright suck and about 2/3 of them are just recolors of existing skins. Event skins are generally very cool looking but will require special lootboxes to obtain, so unless you just have mountains of premium currency gathered from previous battle-passes you're spending money to get them.

The servers run at 20hz for some godawful reason. The standard for most FPS games is 60hz. To put into perspective how bad this is, roblox runs on 128hz servers. The tick-rate is so low it's possible enemies can shoot you before the server has updated to allow you to even see them. Not to mention the fact that the servers constantly have ping and connection issues themselves. You'd think EA would just fix these issues or get better servers but it turns out they don't even operate their own servers, they outsource them to other companies. They literally do not have the ability to fix the servers for their own game. This is abysmal conditions for a game that generates roughly 1 BILLION (yep, with a B) dollars a year.",False

However if you stick it out, getting those few wins becomes really rewarding. I can't stop playing this game, it is very addicting and fun. There are many different aspects to the game that make it well rounded. Once you get to the point where you feel like an average player, just know that there are going to be people that are better than you, the sweats stay sweaty. Play the game for fun, don't try to think you can become an Apex Predator overnight and stick it out. 10/10 recommend.",True

9069,2024-04-11,577.0,"Took away arenas and replaced it with tdm, a game mode that every shooter has had since 2007. Super lazy execs I would assume? Thinking they know the lay of the land, but don't mention that land is previous to the gaming boom. Devs are just as much to blame imo, bc why cant we have tdm and arenas?? Game companies need to stop deciding whats ""hitting its mark"" and whats not, the community decides that. Your game is only as good as the community behind it, and its a really big and painful slap in the face, when the community made you worth millions... and then you tell that same community that they're ""wrong"" about arenas being fun. Imagine i sell something and make millions, and now that I'm rich I tell my customers they're wrong for enjoying what I previously offered. Not everything is everyone's cup of tea.... but that doesn't mean we can only have one friggin style of tea then?",False

There are several maps on which you can play in teams of two or three players. Aside from other battle royal games, this one has a unique characters to choose from that have a different impact on the game. Each one has a unique passive ability, an active tactical ability and an ultimate ability. Some characters are better than others, weapons are poorly balanced and in many situations you feel like there is a lack of loot. If you don‚Äôt like battle royal, you can try arena mode. It‚Äôs 3v3 team deathmatch played across several rounds. At the beginning of each round you have money that you can use to buy/upgrade your arsenal. To make matters worse, we won‚Äòt get Titanfall 3 because they found out how much are those stupid skins earning them.

I was new to the game and wanted to steadily improve through the levels with teammates with similar gear and experience. Instead what happened is we were fighting experienced players and loosing 100% of the time and being immediately eliminated because very experienced players are put in each game as a FEATURE. I paid toward some perks along with four other people but I'm happy to say that we've all been fully refunded now and we're playing a different game cooperatively. Such a shame because the game looked very nice. When idiots in the game design company say: ""Hey! lets put high level players in the same level as noobs"" you need to fire them for drinking and loosing the business money, what you DON'T do is implement this unhinged dumb‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ery. Until this issue is put right it will be a good game spoiled and what a great shame that is? I know a few other people on Steam who have uninstalled the game due to this mysterious insanity.

PS: If you have wasted money on this game only to find out its ruined by a dumb decision as I did, they're at least pretty good with refunds so don't be afraid to ask for your money back.

pps: I'd love to be able to ask the chick who made this decision what she was thinking....

Unfortunately it isn't Titanfall 3, but it does stand proudly on its own two feet as the best battle royale on the market. Every hero is interesting in some way and they're all pretty different in terms of gameplay. The movement system and gunplay have only been slightly modified since Titanfall 2 and are an absolute treat, as always.

It's had its ups and downs, but man, it's gotten to a point the game is so intolerable to play for its many issues that I've had to uninstall. The matches are approximately fixed, either by the game or by players who are cheating.

Cheating, hacking, smurfing is so rampant in this game that it is unplayable just on that front alone. However, the game itself fixes each match by dynamically adjusting variables throughout the match to try to achieve a desired outcome. Respawn wants to control the distribution of wins to losses per player to maximize player retention, which is of course manipulative. Such variables include team stacking, loot generation, dive speed, target tracking, bullet strafing, hit registration, damage count, mobility, even ping rate. Lord knows what I'm missing. When you combine all of that along with the cheaters, afk bots in mixtape mode, and smurfers --this game supremely sucks. I hate that I'm even saying this as a loyal 5 year Apex player, but this game is steaming hot garbage and I cannot defend it or even try to play it any longer.

In a span of 2 months a hacker actually hacked a player in a mid ALGS match to prove a point that their security is easy to hack. They responded with a new event in the game and dont care about the games security and only care about a quick cash grab out of your wallets.

Even if you paid for this seasons battle pass or spent 800 dollars on the event, it doesn't matter because its all GONE! They might fix that part but who knows when that will be, maybe they'll just throw another event.

Also why in the world would they remove steam configs on controller? That is such an unfair advantage. They think steam configs is a ""3rd party software"" well I hate to break to you respawn and EA but steam RUNS your game and no one is playing on your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• EA origin.

Edit: still no account back, but they decided to send to EVERY SINGLE ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• ON THIS GAME 8 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• PACKS !!! That is so ridiculous, we are not clowns, EA !

9758,2024-04-04,241.9,"First of all, the game's worldview and character design are excellent. Each hero has their own unique skills and positioning, from an assassin who excels at stealth to a heavy gunner with full firepower, players can choose the most suitable character according to their preferences and the needs of the game. Not only do these characters have a unique appearance, but the backstory is also appealing, adding more depth and replayability to the game.
Secondly, the game's combat system is fantastic. It uses a first-person shooter method, allowing players to feel the tension and excitement of the battlefield in an immersive way. At the same time, the game is also very rich in tactical elements, and players need to use various skills and strategies flexibly in order to achieve victory in battle. This combination of tactics and shooting makes the game both challenging and fun.

In addition, the teamwork mechanics of the game are also a highlight. In Apex Legends, players need to work closely with their teammates to complete missions and defeat enemies. This kind of teamwork requires not only great individual skills, but also good communication and collaboration skills. This mechanic not only increases the difficulty and challenge of the game, but also improves the interactivity and sociality of the game.
In addition, the game's graphics and sound effects are excellent. Beautiful graphics and realistic sound effects make players feel like they are in the middle of a real battlefield, enhancing the immersion of the game. At the same time, the game is also very well optimized, and it runs smoothly even on lower-spec computers, which makes the game enjoyable for more players.

Instead of dropping in as a nameless soldier, you choose a Legend with unique abilities, like a bloodhound who tracks enemies or a zipline-slinging Pathfinder. This adds a layer of strategy to the fight, with teams combining powers for creative takedowns.
While there's a learning curve, Apex is rewarding to master, and those clutch wins with your squad are pure adrenaline. Just beware, new players can get stomped by seasoned veterans. If you're looking for a free, fast-paced shooter with a unique twist, Apex Legends is definitely worth a shot.",True

Why aren't all heroes available to every player by default? This would make the game even more balanced and fair.
Additionally, the arcade modes cycle in a strange way. Apex has excellent gunplay and movement, but players cannot choose which mode to play, aside from battle royale. Modes like TDM or Control cycle in their own playlist. This mode, similar to Overwatch's Elimination game mode, was highly appreciated as the best game mode in Apex by myself, but it hasn't been available for what, 1.5 years? It seems that the developers are only interested in holding players for Battle Royale It would be beneficial to have the option to play a quick round of TDM or a similar mode.

The changes regarding armor not spawning on the ground anymore and the skillstrees in every match are easily the best thing that have ever happend to battle royale as a franchise. The br-games are balanced and beside some annoying ults everyone should have about the same base hp and shields near endgame. This makes the battle royale more enjoyable than ever before. gg respawn, you single handedly fixed the whole battle royale franchise with this season 20 patch.

Go check out Apex, play some matches and you'll find one of, if not the best, multiplayer shooter available right now. highly recommended.",True

10353,2024-04-01,934.2,"I used to love this game, played through the first few seasons (not sure from when but at least from the second season through the 7th).

This was the first FPS game that I actually enjoyed and tried to improve.

Why I do not recommend this game?

1)Nerfs instead of buffs in an attempt to balance the game:

Unfortunately, the devs kept making the game worse and worse, nerfing path finder's grappling hook speed, wraith's ability to disengage etc, which made the game more slow paced than it was when it begun.

Balance was needed, indeed, but there could've been other tweaks that wouldn't nerf the funnest parts of the game, which was the insane amount of mobility in combat.

This was just the foreshadowing of other glaring issues, Respawn was constantly trying to balance the game by making their most popular characters less and less fun and adding other heroes that, in all honest, were not as interesting. Instead, they should've focused on balancing the current roster by improving existing characters rather than them, however, nerfs was a trend that continued, which honestly just made me less and less interested in mastering any of the heroes.

2) Community just kept getting worse and worse.

As I've played the game I started to notice an ever increase in players leaving matches, AFKing during a game and hackers in lobbies, to the point that it didn't even feel like it was worthy it to have a team to begin with.

Matchmaking kept degrading and I would either be placed with people so much lower than my skills that the game would essentially revolves around dropping off of the ship and instantly dying OR I was queued with someone insane that carried the entire team without giving me or the other team member a chance to shoot our guns and, despite what some people might think, winning that way is NOT fun.

3) Present game is actually WORSE than when I quit.

After season 7 or 8 I essentially stopped playing the game and when I decide to come back to try the new modes that came to substitute arenas I was greeted with 1 match of AFK party members that were probably level farming their accounts; 2) A party that one of the members immediately left as soon as they died 2 times in a row and 3) Penalties for leaving an unranked match despite the fact there was no way that my team and I could win the match in a 2v3v3v3 situation.

I understanding the penalty for early leavers, however, if one of your team members already left, this SHOULD NOT APPLY TO THOSE REMAINING, otherwise you're just forcing your players to suffer through a match they do not stand a chance against.

3) Controller meta

I understand that controllers need some help, but as you can see by the ""professional"" players scene, which basically had most (if not all) serious pro-players switching to controllers (best example is ImperialHall), the aim assist is something that generates an unbalanced game that doesn't really allow for skills to be fairly rewarded and lack thereof, to be punished. It just hurts when you're playing the game and you get 1 clipped by some one when you're jump/strafing, wall bouncing and then you can't even figure out if the person is cheating or just on controller.

If you can't balance both inputs, those inputs SHOULD NOT BE PLAYING IN THE SAME LOBBIES, otherwise, again, it creates a frustrating experience for everyone as the game feels like it punishes your skilled players and reward those that choose to the ""superior"" input.

Td;lr: Respawn had a gold gem that they kept mining in the wrong way and instead of consolidating their fun game they kept corroding and corrupting whatever good the game had. Avoid this if possible. At this point even overwatch 2 is better than apex and that's a blizzard game.",False

Ef cheaters dude, I will never understand the impetus. I've worked so hard on my aim for 4 years, and it's been a lot of fun, but just to have snot-nosed 30 year old man child squeal with glee as he mows down a lobby using daddy destroyer's cheats. I mean, come on. You have to be a special kind of twisted to care enough about your clear lack of ability in a context that ultimately matters little in the grand scheme of life (it's an effing game, one that's super fun SANS THE D#^% CHEATERS who ruin it) that you feel the need to ""one-up"" people with cheats, thereby stunting your own ability to ever get good.

10405,2024-03-31,1555.0,"Used to be a great game but the insane power creep in both legend abilities and gunplay TTK, the game has degraded into a mix between OW and COD. New legends/reworks such as Conduit and Rev with regenerating health make the original healing system useless in fights. Game items and systems such as the Evac tower and support legends allowing anyone on your team to run and craft your banners have made the only focus of the game running away. And this is just the negatives from the degrading gameplay.

Game is infested with hackers/cheaters now with pro players being hacked mid match. You never know if someone was actually good or just cheating. Their anticheat system Easy Anticheat is likely developed by 1 dude in a basement somewhere as evidenced by their completely inactive Twitter (not caling it X) account that suddenly came back from a 5 year absence during their recent cheating controversy.

Last and definitely not least is EA's magnificent impact on the overall pricing and pricing methods used for skins in the game. New bundles have only gone up in price with most being $25-$30 with only 1 decent skin and filler items. Character heirlooms are no more as ""universal heirlooms"" have taken their place. Apparently the previous ""collection events"" as they call them, were not enough with you having to ""collect"" (buy) 24 or so items to get the new heirloom. At least if you could not afford all of them, you could get only the skins which you liked in the event. This is now removed. It is all randomized loot packs only to make you buy more to have a hope of getting the skin you want. Oh and also the price of the packs goes up the more of the items you own in the collection event.

Any who, these reasons and more have killed this game. At least EA will follow their usual plan of milking Apex for the last bits of money, so they can release a new game and do it all over again.",False

this the best game i have played i have been playing sense the week i started on playsation than to xbox to switch than pc this great and i got to keep my 2 hairloom octain and reivien hairloom 10/10 game of thwe year. The gameplay is average at best, and the limited action physics and animation make it as un-playable as it gets. While the game does have a voice acting part (which is the only part I enjoyed in the game), it doesn't help matters. To make matters worse, the dialogue is horrible.A shooter needs more than just compelling, evolving characters; it requires gameplay to match them. Apex Legends is much more fast-paced than other battle royales, and each hero's unique abilities help it stand out against its rivals. Apex Legends is rated T (Teen 13+) with Content Descriptors for Blood and Violence and Interactive Elements that include Users Interact (meaning players can communicate online if they choose) and In-Game Purchases (meaning the game offers the ability to exchange real-world currency for in-game currency or items). Why is apex so hard to be good at? the skill floor/cap in apex is much higher in apex than those games you named. you can't just hit someone with 2-3 shots and down them. the health pools are much higher and each legend is unique in their abilities so a lot of times it's easier to disengage and heal in apex, then they can re-engage from another angle.",True

Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale-hero shooter game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in February 2019, for Nintendo Switch in March 2021, and for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in March 2022. A mobile version of the game designed for touchscreens titled Apex Legends Mobile was released in May 2022 on Android and iOS. The game supports cross-platform play, excluding the aforementioned mobile platforms.

Before the match, players form into two- or three-player squads, and select from pre-designed characters with distinctive abilities, known as ""Legends"". The game has two gameplay modes. In ""Battle Royale"", up to 20 three-person squads or 30 two-person duos land on an island and search for weapons and supplies before attempting to defeat all other players in combat. The available play area on the island shrinks over time, forcing players to keep moving or else find themselves outside the play area which can be fatal. The final team alive wins the round. In ""Arenas"", players form into three-player squads and fight against another squad in a 3v3 team deathmatch over a series of rounds to determine the winner of the match. Teams win when their team has at least 3 points and is 2 points ahead.

Apex Legends is set in the same science fiction universe as Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall series, with several characters from the Titanfall series appearing either as minor characters or playable Legends. Work on the game began around late 2016, though the project remained a secret right up until its launch. The game's release in 2019 came as a surprise, as until that point it had been assumed that Respawn Entertainment was working on a third installment to the Titanfall franchise, the studio's previous major game. Apex Legends received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay, progression system, and fusion of elements from various genres. Some considered it a worthy competitor to other battle royale games. Apex Legends surpassed 25 million players by the end of its first week, and 50 million within its first month. By April 2021, it had approximately 100 million players making it one of the most played video games of all time by player count.
As a seasoned gamer who's explored the vast landscape of battle royale titles, I can confidently say that Apex Legends‚Ñ¢ stands as a shining gem among its peers. Developed by Respawn Entertainment, the same minds behind the iconic Titanfall series, Apex Legends‚Ñ¢ delivers a thrilling and polished experience that sets it apart in the crowded battle royale genre.

One of the most commendable aspects of Apex Legends‚Ñ¢ is its impeccable gameplay mechanics. From the fluid movement system inherited from Titanfall to the diverse array of Legends (characters) each with their unique abilities, every match feels dynamic and full of strategic possibilities. Whether you're gliding through the air with Pathfinder's grappling hook or deploying defensive traps as Caustic, there's a playstyle to suit every preference.

Moreover, Apex Legends‚Ñ¢ excels in fostering teamwork and communication. The game's innovative ping system allows for seamless communication even without voice chat, enabling players to coordinate effortlessly with their squadmates. This emphasis on cooperation adds layers of depth to the gameplay, elevating it beyond mere gunplay.

Visually, Apex Legends‚Ñ¢ is a feast for the eyes. The vibrant, futuristic landscapes of Kings Canyon and World's Edge are beautifully crafted, immersing players in a world brimming with personality and detail. Combined with smooth performance and solid netcode, the game delivers a consistently enjoyable experience even in the heat of intense firefights.

Of course, no review of Apex Legends‚Ñ¢ would be complete without mentioning its ever-evolving content ecosystem. With regular updates, seasonal events, and a robust Battle Pass system, there's always something new on the horizon to keep players engaged. Whether it's the introduction of a new Legend, weapon, or game mode, Respawn Entertainment continues to demonstrate their commitment to keeping the experience fresh and exciting.

In summary, Apex Legends‚Ñ¢ is nothing short of a triumph in the world of battle royale gaming. With its refined gameplay mechanics, emphasis on teamwork, stunning visuals, and commitment to ongoing content updates, it's a title that deserves a place in every gamer's library. So gather your squad, drop into the arena, and prepare for an adrenaline-fueled journey unlike any other.",True

:)",True
10529,2024-03-30,581.1,"Do I recommend this game? That depends on a couple of things.

First of all, this is a team-based battle royale. There is no solos mode (although you can play no-fill trios or duos if you are a masochistic maniac, or don't have any time constraints in your life). Characters are designed for teamplay and the game can become a slog when randoms don't care about this (which is more often than not). There are more casual modes to play if this is a problem for you, though.

What I love about this game: it has probably the deepest, most satisfying and most skillful movement system in a shooter. At launch, it near-perfected the battle royale format with a slew of innovations and QOL improvements, the lack of which would seem almost insulting to a BR player today. The gunplay and overall combat is slick, pretty balanced (despite some seasonal outliers) and also deeply satisfying. The maps are (for the most part) well-designed and interesting to look at and play in. The game has personality (despite some more recent Legend clunkers.) And the skill ceiling is really, really, really high (which is how I sunk more than 800 hours into it over several years, starting on the EA launcher.)

But it becomes difficult to recommend to certain people because of longstanding problems. Inconsistent and sometimes broken audio, designed to be lush and satisfying but not easy to hear what's going on around you. Inconsistent servers - more or less playable one night, then quivering under load the next. Rampant cheating in some regions (I play on London server and it's not so bad there, but I hear NA servers are hellish.) Many, many anecdotes of people having their accounts (which they had spent money in) permabanned with no warning because they used text chat in game with a username deemed offensive AFTER already having that username approved months or years earlier, with a non-existent appeal success rate. Predatory, increasingly lootbox-based cosmetic events with no way to buy what you want, only to gamble for it - on top of already preposterous cosmetics prices.

To summarise, if you like team-based shooters with really smooth movement that offer an incredibly high skill ceiling, and you have a good internet connection, there's almost nothing out there like Apex. Go play, get demolished, watch some coaching videos on youtube, start the fun journey of improvement, and eventually become a worthy Legend. Just don't give EA a single cent of your money.",True

Recently due to my exams I stopped playing the game for 2 days and I was banned for cheating even though I did not even play the game. I thought I might be hacked but i checked and that was not the issue. So I contacted EA support since EA banned me and I asked them to look into the matter they said i was cheating so the ban is permanant. I have been playing apex over a long time and have 614.2 hrs in the game it's my favourite game and I even have a heirloom on my account without spending money I have never used cheats in any game because i think it removes the fun out of your game. majority of my online friends know that I do not cheat even i know i do not cheat .

Yeah, those trunk-swinging, tusk-bearing beasts are the real deal! And guess what? Apex Legends is like the elephant of battle royale games, strong, powerful, and totally dominating the scene!

Alright, so imagine this: you drop into this insane battlefield with your squad, just like a pack of mighty elephants charging through the savannah. The graphics? Dude, they're as crisp as the sun glinting off an elephant's back. The gameplay? Smooth as an elephant's strut.

Now, let's talk about the characters, man! Each one's got their own vibe, just like different species of elephants, ya know? You got your agile ones, your tanky ones, and your sneaky ones. It's like building your own herd, ready to stomp the competition!

And the weapons, oh man! It's like having tusks of destruction in your hands! From pistols to heavy artillery, you'll feel like a bull elephant, charging through anything in your path.

But wait, there's more! The maps in this game are like vast, open plains where you and your squad can roam freely, strategizing like a pack of elephants on the move.

But hey, it's not all sunshine and peanuts, bros. Sometimes you gotta deal with some annoying bugs, just like when an elephant gets a pesky mosquito on its trunk. But hey, the devs are always stomping those bugs out, so no biggie.

Overall, Apex Legends is like the king of the jungle, or should I say, the king of the savannah? It's a wild ride, filled with action, strategy, and more fun than a barrel of monkeys riding on an elephant's back. So grab your buddies, load up the game, and let's charge into battle like a herd of rampaging elephants!

10630,2024-03-29,22.7,"TLDR: (Conclusion) My final thoughts as of right now is that this game is really good and still has a lot of potential in it. However, if EA and Respawn don't start taking this IP more seriously, I fear that this game will collapse whether it's because of cheaters or just overall poor management of the game. As of right now, I can't really recommend this game as all of the problems have unfortunately pushed me away from it, although I won't say the game is bad. I just wish for it to be fixed and polished.

Make no mistake, I may only have around 9 hours on Steam, but have accumulated almost 3,000+ hours on PlayStation. If I were writing this review in the past, I would've highly recommended it as it was, in my opinion, one of if not the best FPS out there. However, over the years, there have been many persistent issues that are still rampant to this day whether due to Respawn's fault or EA's fault. I do want to highlight the positives of this game before I berate it though.

To start, the gun play is really good. Unlike Call of Duty or other games that have random gun recoil, guns in Apex have pattern-like recoil. Whether this is good or bad is up to you but it highlights that many aspects about this game are inherently skill based. The guns, while having been unbalanced for a while (such as the charge rifle being OP, especially in Season 3) are moderately fair and are able to be used because of Hop-Ups (attachments that buff or change guns). Overall, the gun play is solid and should be applauded.

I also want to highlight that this game is really fair in terms of enemy engagements. The time to kill allows for you to survive a potential surprise attack and fully counter which I think is a massive W for the game and makes the game a whole lot more fun as well as intense since one mistake could be the difference between you or the enemy winning.

The movement is also undeniably god-tier and fits the game very well. The common counterpoints against this appraise is that it isn't Titanfall movement and makes you feel slow. While I can understand this critique, I feel that the movement in this game fits it very well for being a Battle Royale FPS and also fits perfectly with the time to kill. In Titanfall, the time to kill is short/nonexistent sometimes which fits well with its movement, that being fast paced and breakneck. In contrast, Apex, while still having a fast movement system, is slower to compensate for the time to kill so that battles aren't drawn out to hell and back.

While this point isn't very massive, I want to point out that the community and randoms are some of the best people ever. Yes, there is the occasional toxic try hard that should really ease up (especially in pubs) but most people are really friendly and cooperative. I've interacted with some very great people in this game that are very understanding that I haven't really been able to find anywhere else.

But enough with the good stuff as the negatives NEED to be addressed.

First, the matchmaking is so ass. I used to play ranked and got diamond a few times. As such, I would expect to be facing diamond/masters players, even outside of ranked. What I get instead is Apex Predators (highest rank players) in my unranked matches. Now, of course this doesn't happen ALL of the time and I don't think that it's a bad thing that this happens sometimes. But, when I see them on a consistent basis, even if they aren't currently Apex Predator, it makes me cringe a little inside. And on the opposite end of the spectrum, when I still played ranked and I was diamond (wanting to go for masters but decided to touch grass), I would get gold players on my team and get steamrolled which is not only unfair to me but also my teammates.

Second, the servers. For anyone who has played half a Season in this game, they'll know what I'm talking about. While they've gotten a little better, it's still hilariously pitiful how bad the servers are. Lag is rampant everywhere as well as just general latency issues, leading to crashes and whatnot. I don't blame this issue on Respawn entirely as EA does back them up with their servers. I'm not sure what servers exactly that they're using right now so I won't comment on it much other than saying that it is also ass and is pitiful for a game this big.

The last point that I will touch on is the most recent controversy as of writing this, which is the tournament hack situation with Genburten and ImperialHal. The fact that hacks were able to be put on their PC's and activated because of, allegedly, EasyAnticheat's software is absolutely ridiculous. I know that this isn't an Apex thing as any game with this anticheat would have the same problem but it's still disappointing on so many levels.

This situation extends to the insane hacks that were made in the past as well as the cheating situation in the game as a whole. In the past, many speed and gun hacks were prevalent, being used to constantly troll top pro players and just make the game overall unfair. How the ""anticheat"" allows this is beyond me which is why I wasn't too surprised when the tournament hack situation came about. And while I could talk about many more situations like this, this post is getting too long and you're not reading anymore.

My final thoughts as of right now is that this game is really good and still has a lot of potential in it. However, if EA and Respawn don't start taking this IP more seriously, I fear that this game will collapse whether it's because of cheaters or just overall poor management of the game.

10649,2024-03-29,78.2,"As a gamer, I play Apex Legends from time to time just for the fun of it. Nonetheless, I am frustrated by the amount of sweaty try-hards who play the game. Even if its fast paced I would like to play for once. The amount of players with cracked-out aim and reflexes quicker than those during a caffeine overdose makes it so I almost slam my computer with a baseball bat.

Wherever you look, there‚Äôs always a group of Pu**y's hiding behind every corner waiting to jump on you with perfect team coordination. For me, this never-ending torture becomes very frustrating when all I want is just one match for relaxation without feeling like I'm applying at Cirque du Soleil.

The fact that people rely on bunny hopping or slide spamming only worsens the matter making what should be calm gaming appear as Olympic level gymnastics competition. Trust me when I say that IT'S JUST A GAME, CALM THE F*CK DOWN!!

However, despite the hatred, there's still a bit of hope for us NORMAL players. We persevere, dropping into the map, dodging bullets and praying for that elusive victory. Because deep down, we know that skill and determination can overcome even the sweatiest of adversaries.

But hey that's just a REVIEW, MY REVIEW!!!
Thank's for reading

UPDATE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The game sure is a rollercoaster of chaos and annihilation where every move could mean victory or defeat. Sure, there are moments of frustration with the try-hards and the relentless action, but beneath it all lies a gaming experience like no other.

Respawn Entertainment has made a masterpiece of fluid movement and satisfying gunplay, with diverse characters and evolving gameplay. Beyond the challenges, there's a welcoming community, always ready to share tips.

And when you finally become victorious, whether with your squad or solo, the rush of adrenalin is like no other. So, despite the challenges, Apex Legends offers an experience worth diving into.",True

Von diesem St√ºck Spielinhalt habe ich eine sehr gemischte Meinung.
Eigentlich k√∂nnte man sagen, dass es rein optisch und habtisch ned ene von de Games ist, die (ah) angs' kriesche, aberrr wenn die Cheater mal wieder ihre Tage haben und aus ihrem dunklen versifften Keller kommen und das ganze Game mit absolut behinderten Cheats vollm√ºllen denke, und frage ich mich, ob die Entwickler hinter Apex sich den ganzen Tag nur einen Schrubben oder wirklich am Game arbeiten.
Aber naja,
machste nix.",True
10669,2024-03-29,89.3,"Apex Legends is a game I played a lot back in 2020-2021, the game has a lot of depth with its many characters and mechanics, the gunplay is satisfying and it has a lot of personality. But I gotta put the nail in the coffin with this one because it's just impossible to actually enjoy Apex right now.

The matchmaking sucks ass, you'll be trying to chill out and play a casual game, trying to get some challenges done or just going for a few kills, maybe trying out a new character and the game will put you with the sweatiest ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I've ever seen. I've played a little over 200 hours (I used to play the game before it came to Steam) but I've seen so many Predators with 5000+ kills on just a single character while I've got like 700 total, and this is not even a rare occurance, I see players like this basically every other match. This game has a lot of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to learn and it doesn't help that half the lobby is filled with people that are playing the game since launch, it's ridiculous.

It could be fun if the game was actually balanced when it came to who you face, because there really is a lot of depth and interesting gameplay here. But the game just feels depressing to play with the people I'm going against.

And don't even get me started on usual multiplayer game stuff, teammates giving up at first ring because they decided to 1v3 some random squad in the distance or just quitting in general (which is really stupid because now you can revive even after the banner expires with the Support passive), third parties completely ruining your fun, that one cheater or two that loves to ruin the game, that sort of stuff.

If you haven't played Apex, stay away from it. It absolutely hates players that are actually trying to learn the game on their own pace, unless you have no responsibilities and 10 hours to waste everyday, then you might have a small chance of enjoying yourself.",False

10739,2024-03-29,61.5,"Alright, I like this game, it's fun, but only because it's new and I play with friends. This game has a few serious issues which makes me want to not recommend this game. It's a headache to run, from constant crashes every 1-2 games to facing infinite loading screens fro hours on end, the amount of bugs I've tried to fix are endless, and pretty much none of them are on my end. I've checked, trust me. The issues are Apex specific, they never happen with another game, and if not for friends, I would not have touched this game. This game feels less playable than cyberpunk at launch, that's how bad it can be. Of course I've managed to fix some issues, but there's always some other issue which I end up facing. Plus EA literally collects data on you in game. I am not kidding I have spent at least 10 hours trying to get in and be able to play the game rather than playing. I will probably continue to play this game for a bit before I fully quit it but I can't really recommend it to anyone, as of now, it's been a net negative experience. There is also the matter of fact that cheaters are ridiculously rampant to the point that I'm most likely getting cheaters in silver lobbies, and if they're not cheaters, if I'm wrong, then they are not silver players, which makes playing competitive not fun. These same cheaters can have remote control access to your computer and download potential viruses on your computer while playing the game.

10749,2024-03-29,5.1,"In the vast landscape of video games, few titles have managed to achieve the level of acclaim and admiration that Apex Legends has garnered since its release. Developed by Respawn Entertainment, Apex Legends has risen to prominence as not just a game, but a cultural phenomenon. As a passionate gamer who has explored countless virtual worlds, I can confidently assert that Apex Legends stands tall as the pinnacle of gaming excellence, surpassing its competitors in numerous aspects and setting a new standard for what it means to be the best game in the world.

At the heart of Apex Legends' greatness lies its unparalleled gameplay experience. Unlike traditional battle royales, where players engage in generic shootouts on a static map, Apex introduces a cast of Legends, each with their own distinct abilities and personalities. This innovative approach injects layers of strategy and depth into every match, challenging players to not only master gunplay but also synergize with their teammates and utilize their Legends' abilities to outmaneuver and outsmart their opponents.

One of the most compelling aspects of Apex Legends is its emphasis on teamwork and communication. The game's ping system, a stroke of genius in game design, allows players to convey vital information with remarkable ease, fostering a sense of camaraderie and cooperation among teammates. Whether you're signaling enemy locations, suggesting loot, or coordinating your next move, the ping system ensures that every player, regardless of their communication preferences, can contribute effectively to their team's success.

Moreover, Apex Legends excels in its dynamic and ever-evolving gameplay. The introduction of new Legends, weapons, and gameplay mechanics with each season keeps the experience fresh and exciting, ensuring that players always have something new to discover and master. From the pulse-pounding action of the Arenas mode to the high-stakes battles in the main battle royale, Apex offers a diverse array of experiences that cater to a wide range of playstyles and preferences.

Beyond its gameplay innovations, Apex Legends boasts a rich and immersive world filled with lore and storytelling. The game's lore unfolds through in-game events, animated shorts, and interactive storytelling, drawing players into its vibrant universe and captivating them with its rich tapestry of characters, conflicts, and mysteries. Whether you're delving into the tragic past of Bloodhound or uncovering the enigmatic origins of the Apex Games, there's a depth to Apex Legends' narrative that sets it apart from its peers.

Apex Legends' technical prowess is also deserving of praise. The game's stunning visuals, smooth performance, and impeccable netcode ensure that players are fully immersed in the action, with minimal distractions or technical hiccups. Whether you're traversing the lush landscapes of Kings Canyon or engaging in intense firefights in the sprawling urban environments of World's Edge, every moment in Apex Legends is a testament to Respawn's dedication to delivering a polished and seamless gaming experience.

Furthermore, Apex Legends' community is a shining example of positivity and inclusivity in the gaming world. Unlike some online communities plagued by toxicity and negativity, the Apex community is known for its warmth, friendliness, and willingness to help fellow players improve. Whether you're teaming up with strangers in matchmaking or playing with friends in a premade squad, the camaraderie and sportsmanship exhibited by the Apex community elevate the game to new heights.

In terms of monetization, Apex Legends adopts a consumer-friendly approach that prioritizes player satisfaction over profits. While the game offers a variety of cosmetic items for purchase, including character skins, weapon camos, and emotes, these items are purely optional and have no impact on gameplay. This ensures that every player, regardless of their spending habits, can enjoy the full Apex experience without feeling pressured to spend money to remain competitive.

In conclusion, Apex Legends isn't just the best game in the world‚Äîit's a masterpiece that has redefined what it means to be a multiplayer shooter. With its innovative gameplay, emphasis on teamwork and communication, dynamic gameplay, rich storytelling, technical excellence, inclusive community, and consumer-friendly business model, Apex Legends stands as a shining example of gaming done right. Whether you're a hardcore competitive gamer or a casual player looking for some fun, Apex Legends offers an unparalleled gaming experience that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",True

Season 20 held so much promise, yet it has become virtually unplayable due to this issue. Respawn urgently needs to reconsider their approach to dealing with hackers. Playing in ranked mode has become a disheartening experience.

Here are a few suggestions:

1. Implementing death cams across all game types could significantly reduce false reports and provide clearer evidence of cheating.

2. Setting a minimum requirement for kills, such as 2000 kills, before allowing players to participate in ranked matches would deter cheaters who easily create new accounts to exploit the system.

3. Enforcing tracker banners to display essential statistics like kills, wins, and games played would offer better insight into the players encountered. Allowing players to conceal their stats only fuels suspicion and undermines the integrity of the game.

4. Offer PC players the choice to disable crossplay! It's illogical to grant console players this feature while neglecting PC users.",False

10763,2024-03-28,5.0,"Microtransactions and Loot Boxes: Like many free-to-play games, Apex Legends utilizes microtransactions and loot boxes as part of its monetization strategy. Some players argue that this creates a pay-to-win environment or encourages spending beyond what feels fair or reasonable.

Balance Issues: Balancing characters, weapons, and abilities in a multiplayer game can be challenging. Some players may feel that certain characters or weapons are overpowered, leading to frustration and imbalance in gameplay.

Server and Technical Issues: Online multiplayer games like Apex Legends rely on stable servers to provide a smooth gaming experience. However, server outages, lag, and other technical issues can disrupt gameplay and frustrate players.

Skill-based Matchmaking: While skill-based matchmaking is intended to pair players of similar skill levels, some players feel that it leads to unbalanced matches, where they are pitted against opponents who are significantly better or worse than they are.

Content Updates and Support: Maintaining a healthy player base and keeping the game fresh with regular updates and new content is crucial for the longevity of a multiplayer game. Some players may feel that Apex Legends lacks sufficient updates or fails to address community feedback and concerns adequately.

Toxicity and Community Behavior: Like many online multiplayer games, Apex Legends can sometimes suffer from toxicity in its player community. Negative behavior such as harassment, cheating, or griefing can detract from the overall experience and drive players away.

Repetitive Gameplay: Despite its unique mechanics and engaging gameplay, some players may find Apex Legends' gameplay loop to become repetitive over time, especially if they prefer more variety or complexity in their gaming experiences.

Optimization and Performance: Depending on players' hardware and system specifications, they may encounter performance issues or struggle to achieve smooth framerates, impacting their enjoyment of the game.",False

Gun-play is fun, movement is fun, playing with friends when it's going well is fun, the combat is generally satisfying.

-
Garbage matchmaking, no match abandonment penalties, people actively land separately from the team by a couple hundred meters and then ragequit. You're practically forced to play with a premade squad which removes all the fun of meeting other people in a massively multiplayer game.
The character design is absolute ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and that's still an understatement - I don't know who RE and EA are hiring for their art department but they surely have either 5 minute deadlines per project or they have no directors whatsoever.
There is zero moderation for names, text and voice chats, or verification systems for reporting people; which leads to false flags, racist neanderthals screaming into their 50 cent microphone, and whatever else.
And in line with the recent news about a massive security breach, a lot of trust for the devs has been incinerated because they have yet to make any formal announcement on this platform.",False

Once about halfway through cutting I heard someone break into my house through a window, I knew I needed to speed up the process so I quickly ripped my balls the rest of the way off. I heard the stranger walking up the stairs to my room. I tried to hide in the corner facing the wall, with the tactic of, if I can't see him, he can't see me. His foot steps got closer and closer until he was right behind me. In under 10 seconds he shot on my back, and just as fast as he came he was gone.

Due to match making setting up new players with expert level players the learning curve is so steep that it takes any fun of this game out of the equation when starting off. This is not a game you can jump into and feel like your providing any help to your team right out of the gate. It would probably take a month or more practicing in the firing range using different configurations, and range techniques to even get to a decent player status level. But that's boring as who wants to play against bots for that long.

They rent 20 tick servers, causing multiple problems including but not limited to: Severe rubber banding, net code errors, servers dying when a new update or season drops, dying 3 seconds after going behind cover due to the refresh rate of the servers, and hit reg issues out the ass. Another sticking point is the non existent anticheat. Aimbotters, walls, silent aimbot, DDOSing, servers populated entirely by bots (not bad players the actual bot), and people connecting into console lobbies from pc and cheating on there. Also, EA is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• greedy and the monetization of this game is super scummy; $140 melee cosmetics, bundles costing anywhere from $20-$30, the battlepass is rarely worth it, not to mention they are introducing new collection events costing around $360 for a cosmetic death box (equivalent to a digital gravestone). They are charging $350 for a DIGITAL ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• BOX that only people who kill you can see, and that's only in a couple game modes since others don't even have players drop a box when they die. Not to mention the community being either pants on head retarded or haven't left their game since the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• pandemic started, so not playing with friends is a gamble on whether you get someone who has a favorite flavor of crayon or someone who spends half their paycheck on blood pressure medication (and god help you if you live in the EU and have to listen to some of the most 1600-ass slurs known to man). The only decently designed part of this game are the actual characters since most are actually fun depending on your playstyle.

The game should be great, in theory. However the community is awful. Either the game matches me up with someone who has no clue what they're doing and just wants to loot the entire game... or someone who never has stopped playing a day in their life and blames you for their death as the rush into the middle of two teams in the open. The cosmetics are overpriced for mid quality skins. Don't get me started on heirlooms. Severs need an upgrade. Truly a toxic cesspool for sweats and tears to collectively feed a greedy corporations profits.",False
11140,2024-03-26,557.0,"In 2010 then-president of EA said something about single-player games being ‚Äúfinished‚Äù. Here we are now with EA publishing one of the best and most successful single-player titles of 2019 under its wing.

Fallen Order tells an original story of Cal Kestis, an apprentice jedi hiding on a scrapyard planet called Bracca. Once he gets found by the Empire hunting the jedi and rescued by some strangers, he learns that the goal of his saviours is to restore the fallen Jedi Order. Having really no other place to go to, Cal agrees to help and embarks on a journey full of danger and failures, but also with a lot of soul-searching and new friends.
The main advantage of the story is its characters. The main cast is not only always there for Cal, either just to chat about everyday things on the ship or to actually listen to his problems and be a genuine support on the journey, but they also impact the events of the game in a not-so direct way. Greez is being hunted by space gangsters which give you a hard time later, Cere .
Probably the most important character though, is our companion who is always there for us. Although the little droid, BD-1 doesn‚Äôt really say words, he communicates really well with Cal. The ‚Äúdialogues‚Äù between the two form a very cool dynamic and really bond us with the two characters.
Generally the writing of this game is amazing. The quieter moments with the crew members feel genuine and immersive. It‚Äôs this kind of absorbing story in which instead of saying ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs a trap, nice‚Äù, you say ‚ÄúDAMN IT CAL IT‚ÄôS AN OBVIOUS FU.CKING TRAP DON‚ÄôT GO IN THERE PLEASE‚Äù
Also, The Hot Goth Alien Cult Mommy.

In terms of gameplay, I'd say this is a softcore souls-like. An enemy that kills you takes your current xp and sends you back to your last meditation circle. To recover your xp you have to reach him again and hit him. Now it‚Äôs a cool attempt to make you more careful not to die and lose stuff, but it‚Äôs not really working. I was playing on second to hardest difficulty and honestly, I either did not care about the lost xp (it‚Äôs really easy and fast to farm back) or I just went and hit the guy that killed me not even because I wanted my experience back, but because he was just in the way.
The combat is sweet. You can do parries and precision dodges or just roll around if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with your timing. Low on health? Call out to BD to toss you a stim right into your hand. Fighting with your lightsaber lets you do a variety of moves such as throwing it at enemies or literally teleporting to them to close in on them faster. Your fancy glowstick also has a two-sided mode ‚Äì it exceeds at fighting groups of enemies. It also has an attack in which you dual wield the glowstick and many players wish that this was a permanent mode.
You can also use The Force. In combat you can slow enemies down, pull them towards you or (my personal favorite, classic move) yeet them off a cliff (as a side note - many games have cocky enemies talking sh.it, and then get their asses floored seconds later, but hearing a clone yell ‚ÄúYOU ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO ME, JEDI"" while falling down the abyss after getting yeeted off a cliff face is something else). Powers have many versions; a charged push can throw away multiple clones or even a big troll-thing.
The Force is also used to solve many different environmental puzzles either to progress or to unlock a secret. Outside of combat you explore several places in the galaxy. You move around by climbing some plants, wall running, swinging on some vines, etc. Cal runs and jumps (man, hopping around was just so cool to me) around in a very intuitive way and it‚Äôs all incredibly animated. What I must say though, is that swimming overall feels very off and has some really bizarre animations.
At first visit to some places the exploration feels really natural and immersive. I hardly ever got lost anywhere, even in the more open areas, and if I was ever in trouble, I could always use the map to see unexplored paths I had left.
Unfortunately, backtracking to certain locations to get the leftover secrets and chests is an absolute disaster. Dathomir is a great planet, it‚Äôs a challenging, beautiful wasteland with cool lore and story. Going back to it and trying to reach the swamp area again is just a sh.itshow though. It‚Äôs so unnecessarily convoluted. It even seems like in this one place, past the bridge in the village should be an opening to just let you through. Instead, it‚Äôs blocked by this little wooden wall that you can‚Äôt jump over, so you must go around the whole location. It‚Äôs a serious flaw that is not only easily fixable, but just feels like somebody just forgot to put something there.

The game looks very good and has some amazing landscapes. It also has a photo mode to play with. Regarding animation ‚Äì most of them are amazing and very creative (BD tossing you heals is just so good). Besides swimming, the only complaint would be the lack of finisher animations. Some foes only have one and others get repetitive after a while.

Now the sound design ‚Äì maaan, this is THE science fiction game. The space crafts flying around, blasters shooting, things exploding, funny glowsticks swinging around. They‚Äôre not only high quality and very characteristic, but they all just have the oompff you know? The soundtrack amazingly complements the vibe. It‚Äôs very movie-like. What blew my mind is that if you listen to the OST album of this game on Spotify PC, it replaces the player bar with an extending lightsaber. How cool is that?

I didn‚Äôt really encounter any technical issues, but what‚Äôs funny is that there is an infinite jumping glitch in the game that they did not patch. It‚Äôs not really that useful though, because you skip many invisible triggers while using it and it screws up the collision and map loading. It is funi.

I was never a Star Wars fan. This is probably my first encounter with this franchise since Republic Commando on Xbox Classic or randomly seeing The Clone Wars on TV. Nothing wrong with the universe itself, I just never really got hooked by it.
I was never a Star Wars fan, but luckily Fallen Order doesn‚Äôt require you to be one. It‚Äôs a wonderful adventure by itself. Maybe even a good starting point into the SW universe for a newbie like myself ‚Äì and don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm in no position to say that this is a good piece of the Star Wars media not knowing the rest of it. Nonetheless, from my experience with it, I can say that it‚Äôs enough to get you hooked on.",True

Unironically giving it a bad review because I suck.

11188,2024-03-26,152.3,"Valkyrie is the epitome of all things that make me wanna bust.

Valkyrie is an icon of lust and fertility. Now i realize that (cannonically) she is a lesebian, but this does not concern me.
Her appearence and the way she presents herself is just astoundingly erotic, i also LOVE her PErSONALITY and she mAKE MY PENIS HARD AND TINGLE WITH JOY.

She is perfect in every way imaginable, her hair, beautiful eyes and her hourglass figure.

Her physical appearance is just astonishing, her boobs and her buttocks create this aura of what i call the ""Boner Zone.""

And above all that, she is the ultimate waifu. I happen to know this information because i own 3 bodypillows, a decorative bong and one figurine that is on my desk as i am writing.

I might also add that she looks quite fertile despite her age. (milf material)

Her voicelines also indicate a degree of comedy and self awareness that the average lowlife is just not smart enough to appreciate, I however, do.

Her quick witted comebacks and clever jokes suggest a level of intelect higher than the average gal, this makes her seem more approachable for a similarly intelectual being such as myself, thus making her and i even more compatible sexually as she will simply be able to understand me and my desires better than the average bumbling simpleton.

All this to say, she is mine. You all have no chance of getting this gorgeous SEX ICON, for i am ubercharged with rizz and will be able to woo m'lady on a scale that you most likely can't comprehend.

She will obviously be able to rely on me to defend her in any situation, so stay away creeps and scoundrels.",True

But hey, programming acceptable matchmaking and securing your games server access is second (or third or fourth) priority after making recolors for every second event and calling it content, naturally.

EA has long lost it's former glory, it's not a game dev studio anymore, it's just like any other company enslaved by their greed, a capitalist cash cow, recycling old products that somewhat work, only to gain the biggest profit possible with the least amount of investment.

All of the MTX are optional, no need to spend real money

11649,2024-03-22,230.2,"Nearly impossible to have fun due to unfair matchmaker. Not recommended to people who don't have much experience with shooters.

The way Apex Legends mixes elements of character-based shooters with the battle royale mode is pretty interesting. The game is fast-paced, with many high risk, high reward movement mechanics that require timing and skillful aiming to execute properly. It can be super fun.
The only problem is matchmaking: The game seemingly doesn't differentiate good players from bad ones. You constantly get put up against people who have been playing since release and they simply don't allow you to have any fun. 95% of the time I was getting killed in a single burst by someone with 34 000 kills or more. Even though I only have 230 hours of play time and absolutely suck at the game by comparison...

This game was just perfect in every possible way, honestly speaking I don't even know what they could've made better. The guns, the movement, the map, the new stuff they add, just everything about Apex Legends was so good. The first time I played it was on the exact release date (Feb 4, 2019) on my PS4, and I played it with my cousin. We decided to play in groups of three so we could get some help to win since we were new to the game. Surprisingly, our first game matched us with someone who was already pretty good at the game, even though it was the first day it was ever launched. He totally carried us to victory, no joke. Me and my cousin only got like 1 kill each, and we ended up winning our first game on the first release day, which is still crazy to me. I'm grateful I got to play most of the seasons, especially the OG ones. I loved it a lot, including the Hemlock, which is one of my favorite guns in the whole game. Honestly, I can't complain except for the fact that your account isn't the same on PS4 or PS5 or any other platform you play on. I played on PS4 for a long time and had so many cool skins, battle pass stuff, and gun wraps. My account was fully maxed out until I switched to PC. Even though I used the same EA account, it took me to a new account on PC. It basically had nothing on it, like starting over again. It got me really annoyed and frustrated, but I managed to grind a bit more and almost maxed it out again. I really wish I could play this game more. Also, I don't like that there isn't a solo mode. I kinda get why, but sometimes playing with random people can be really annoying. But again, I can't complain because most games aren't as good as Apex Legends. I honestly recommend anyone to play this game, though I suggest playing it with a friend or family member, just anyone you can talk to. Overall, it's a great game and definitely beats most shooter games like Fortnite, Warzone, PUBG, and the rest. This is just my opinion and if you disagree, that's okay.

11803,2024-03-21,999.8,"lets get the good stuff about the game out the way since there's not as much to say

firstly the high fps this game can achieve while looking as nice as it does is impressive yes i often notice the render distances going from blurry to detailed but it doesn't diminish the visuals to much

second the unique design and mechanics in the game is also impressive

third the balance of a weapons power in the game has always been pretty good

now the bad stuff

firstly ive never been very impressed with the servers ping and latency in general has always felt higher then it should be take rainbow six siege for a example very similar server locations yet much better latency even if a player in the uk went on to us server in r6 it would be smoother than doing the same on apex

second audio is often very unreliable sometimes there's a enemy right next to you and you hear nothing other times they can be 100+ meters away and sound like there right next to you

third the biggest issue is the rank system which to be fair to apex is often awful in any shooter game this season in particular has made it very hard to rank up since you get more points the more kills you get and get very little points for the placement your team gets you might be thinking skill issue but getting kills can be greatly effected by the team you get which leads us to the other problem of the rank system i can honestly say about 80% of all the randoms i get look like they haven't played a game in there life before they are often selfish stupid and unaware of the games environment im not a pro at the game and yet these randomers are worse they play the game like it call of duty most of the time then run off after a squad without looting properly at the start of a game die then complain i honestly see no difference in the skill between silver randoms vs plat randoms if i got matched with randoms with my skill level id be plat 1 or 2 instead im bouncing between gold and plat 3 also its much harder to get kills in apex over damage which by the way you get no extra points for same thing with assists this forces randoms to play for themselves rather than in a team im not saying they should revert back to old ranked where you'd get points just for placement but i think it needs to be balanced out more so you feel rewarded for damage assists and high placement games

fourth its addictive its my main source of stress and i rarely have fun on it but when i have a good game it convinces me its all worth it

fifth thing only aplliies to the latest season
the anti cheat sys keeps crashing the game aswell as the gpu drivers there seems to of been a patch that improved said issue but it still happens from time to time

so whats the solution well
increase how many points players get depending on the placement they get so solos dont have to rely on randomers as much
improve latency on all apex servers
match players with similar skill to each other better
increase how many points a player gets when getting damage when 1 or more players in there team are dead
fix audio

Me a plat 3, going against number 1 pred and a 674 pred. this game is not beginner friendly at all. so i recommend playing with friends who are rlly good at the game so you can at least have someone to carry u to victory. i love the characters and the story line. this game is great but the overall game is POOPOO the amount of pc players that complain about aim assist is insane. pc players have a bigger advantage to win against a console player such as movement, and movement while looting, ext.. but they cant handle a loss against a controller player. i have won against my controller player bf and all of his friends many times, and they got me low MANY times and theyve been playing the came wayyy longer than me. pro pc players do anything to nerf aim assist even tho its really not as good as they think. this comes to the conclusion that apex only listens to pro players and not players that waNT to succeed in the game",True

Yield:

1cup/227 grams mascarpone (8 ounces)
FOR THE ASSEMBLY
1¬æcups good espresso or very strong coffee
2tablespoons rum or cognac

About 24 ladyfingers (from one 7-ounce/200-gram package)
1 to 2ounces bittersweet chocolate, for shaving (optional)


Done correctly, a classic tiramis√π can be transcendent. A creamy dessert of espresso-soaked ladyfingers surrounded by lightly sweetened whipped cream and a rich mascarpone, tiramis√π relies heavily on the quality of its ingredients. If you don‚Äôt have a barista setup at home, pick up the espresso at a local coffee shop, or use strongly brewed coffee. As for the ladyfingers, make your own or buy them, but keep in mind that store-bought varieties can range from soft and spongy (like angel food cake) to hard and crunchy (like biscotti).

11922,2024-03-20,1.0,"Apex Legends Anti-Cheat and the Specter of Compromised Systems

As a seasoned player deeply invested in the vibrant world of Apex Legends, it pains me to relay an unsavory truth: the purported safeguard of fair play, the anti-cheat system, is more akin to a sieve in a storm. Allow me to elaborate on this disconcerting matter.

One cannot deny the veritable epidemic of cheaters tarnishing the competitive landscape of Apex Legends. Whether it's through aimbots, wallhacks, or other nefarious means, the sanctity of fair play is continuously compromised. In response, Respawn Entertainment, in their infinite wisdom, introduced an anti-cheat system purportedly designed to safeguard the integrity of the game. Yet, what we've been served is nothing short of a bitter concoction of false promises and shattered trust.

Enter the ghastly specter of remote code execution. It's a nightmare scenario straight out of a cyberpunk dystopia, yet here we are, grappling with its grim reality within the confines of our gaming sanctuaries. Reports have surfaced, detailing how the very anti-cheat mechanism intended to shield us from the blight of cheating has become a gateway for malevolent entities to infiltrate our systems with impunity. This, dear readers, is not a cautionary tale; it's an ongoing saga of negligence and ineptitude.

One is left to ponder: how did we arrive at this sorry state of affairs? Was it an oversight, a glaring gap in the fortress walls overlooked by those tasked with our protection? Or was it a manifestation of hubris, a misguided belief that our systems were impervious to the machinations of the malicious? Whichever the case may be, the end result remains unchanged: a community left disillusioned, vulnerable, and frankly, incensed.

In the realm of online gaming, trust is a currency more valuable than any in-game loot or accolade. And yet, Respawn Entertainment's handling of the anti-cheat debacle has squandered this precious commodity with reckless abandon. Players no longer feel secure within the confines of their digital domains, haunted by the specter of compromised systems and the omnipresent threat of exploitation.

To Respawn Entertainment, I extend a challenge: rise to the occasion, reclaim the trust you've squandered, and fortify the defenses of Apex Legends against the scourge of cheating and remote code execution. Until then, the disillusioned masses shall continue to lament the sorry state of affairs, reminiscing about a time when the battlefield was fair and the playing field level.",False

11998,2024-03-19,1204.7,"I love Apex Legends. Here's my review on it:

Pros:
1. The Legends in this game are precious. Each has a backstory, motivation, and unique personality. And their abilities reflect themselves. They aren't isolated; there are lore pieces released by Respawn that keeps me engaged and invested in the characters.
2. Respawn creative ideas and Titanfall's legacy: The game's movement system is very fluid and opens creativity from players. The ping system allows for quick and easy communication without needing a microphone, which can be helpful for those playing with random teammates. And the armor swap and a lot of other features from this game are just great.
3. The game is complex and trains your brain in a lot of way. The character abilities themselves add a layer of complexity, unlike other BR games. There are a lot of variables happening in this game and pushes you to make decisions quickly. Armor swaps, third parties, the ring closing, positioning, reviving your teammates, knockdown shields, survival kits, drop ships, respawn beacons, legends' ultimates and abilities... It's a fun game for your brain!


Cons:
1. Not beginner friendly. There's little room for error, and fights can turn on a dime. This is especially punishing for new players.
2. Not solo queue friendly. This game is heavily focused on teamwork and randoms will ruin your mood a lot.
3. Servers suck. You use a high end ISP and LAN connection? It won't do anything against EA's low quality servers that would give you constant high ping and high packet loss. Even pro players and streamers still get this problem. But I don't blame them that much. Apex DOES need higher level of servers than other game. Too bad EA is an indie company.

Getting into servers with high ping and packet loss on a regular basis this season(Season 20 when this was written).

The game was hit with a wave of hackers/exploits years ago and is still suffering ever since. Now and then you'll see a message saying a player has been banned for hacking mid-game, but more often than not, you will be shot down by a L-Star user from halfway across the map while fighting two people from two different teams. No, that wasn't a ""third-party"" that was clearly some guy using an exploit.

The fact that a hacker has managed to derail a competitive event speaks volumes about the amount of resources EA has been putting into cyber security the community speaking up about this for years. EAC(Easy Anti-Cheat) has made it clear in a tweet that this is not a fault on their side but it a client issue.

This game made the Battle-Royale genre enjoyable for me and it would be sad to watch it die to negligence. Now is not a good time to start playing the game as it will be hard for a new player to tell the difference between a legit skilled player vs a hacker. The game is tough as it is and can be demoralising when you're starting out, even more so when you lose to a cheater. EA has refused to publicly address the ALGS hacking issue and I doubt they will confirm it to be an RCE vulnerability in the client.

12199,2024-03-18,534.7,"So, this game right now has several problems and I do really enjoy playing it, or at least I did until recently.

I'm going to adress the elephant in the room immediatly, the matchmaking. I have never seen a game with worse matchmaking before and I played my fair share of games with matchmaking issues. But Apex gets it to another level and Respawn/EA go ahead and say that its the best course for the game. For those unaware, Apex does not match people with equal ranks against each other, and anyone who says otherwise hasnt played this game enough. Everyone who has played this game has probably seen a full stack of Apex predators in their games before. I personally match into a full stack or at least 1 Apex Predator every session. For me in Pubs a lobby like that is an instant disconnect, Ranked i still try to get some points but eventually, unless really unlucky, they just outclass the entire lobby immediatly, and this is not coming from someone who just started playing, I hit master last season after a long and exhausting grind and even then me and my duo usually just avoid games where we know we are outclassed, I know for many this would be a case of bad sportsmanship or I should at least try, but so you have a comparison: Imagine playing soccer as someone who just joined a local team for you on a minor level, you have a tournament bracket of small regions of your home, and then manchester united or any other world class soccer team. I would love to say this is just a minority of games but sadly because of the matchmaking only prioretizing low queue times, High skill players can get matched into low level lobbies on many occassions, so essentially the top 1 % are currently dominating every pub match and ranked is not in a good state. I personally have also been matched into lobbies full of silvers where it felt like just farming kills, from a competetive standpoint it is depressing and from a casual gaming standpoint a major annoyance.

A small note on microtransactions: I know the prices are insane, and this game probably has almost as much audacity when it comes to selling skins than Overwatch 2, but it's F2P, so i refuse to argument against it because people can chosse to ignore the store and there are not many p2w items in the game except for a few skins with better ironsights.

I don't just want to roast the game though since I have enjoyed it for quite a lot, the gameplay feels really good, so does the gunplay, except Volt Ironsights, god I hate them but thats just a personal skill issue. No but honestly the character design, gunplay and gameplay feel really great and since the sandbox is changing constantly every season feels really refreshing, evo shields giving abilities was a change that got me back into the game for a while as well since it just seems like a really fun idea.

So while the game is really fun to play right now you are submitting yourself to a beating by the top players or streamers every 2nd round on high levels and on low levels you are getting farmed anyways because people are farming their 20 kill and damage badges because you can just go on a loss streak by disconnecting for 40 games in a row, get queued into silvers because the game doesnt really care and then steamroll them, get ur badges and after that win ur immediatly back into plat lobbies if not worse.

TLDR: The matchmaking is a major issue right now alongside some others I was too lazy to write about, game is fun but in current state cannot recommend it.",False

Not sure what the reviews on hackers are on about...played this game off and on for some time and it scratches an itch MOST FPS games can't, including COD, Valorant, Fortnite, etc. As far as I'm aware, I've never encountered any hackers, I'd argue that the ceiling in regards to skill is just that high that it makes exceptional player seem like they're hacking.

The pricing on most of the items are outrageous...but I've only spent $10 on the game and the game pass essentially pays for itself.

Wished they kept Arena though, that's the one aspect that I like about Valorant, choose you weapon queue up in a small team in a decently sized map and fight. The movement, predictability and repetitiveness of Valorant doesn't appeal to me.

Match Making for newbies could be better. I can see why new players can be turned off if you're dropped in a match with experienced players. Though as of recent, Match Making has seem to improved, this includes queuing by myself and queuing with my friends who have a KDR of less than .70",True

12505,2024-03-16,293.7,"*this is my opinion but me trying to be direct to point*

At its current state i will not recommend this game to any single person i know unless they are a massochist.

the current state of the game is the following

extremely fast time to kill if landing shots. (this is extremely punishing if matches arnt balanced)
lots of tech for movement (extremely punishing if you dont know how to or cannot do it)
gunplay feels amazing to use

the big issue is there seems to be 0 mm other then get players in lobbies fast

*below is personal opinion for the game as someone who does not play only 1 game and likes variety*

the game is effectively unplayable unless this is the only game you play to learn all the tricks how to manipulate your hitbox and track players properly. the gunplay while lovely is too fast paced for a game which if you die early you are stuck either waiting for your squad to come get you or waiting for the next match. but due to how the game is that means multiple minutes of waiting just to get into a short fight that is over quick. making the entire loop feel more like your waiting then actually playing the game. Due to the character design some characters are effectively useless as they are so weak playing them is just shooting yourself in the foot that causes every match to be the same 6 characters fighting constantly with rarely one of the less good characters.

p.s. the only people who play the game anymore see to be the people who no life the game. so all skill based issues are amplified

12595,2024-03-16,6.9,"Apex Legends is a free-to-play hero shooter battle royale game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It features a unique blend of character abilities, fast-paced action, and strategic team play. Here's a breakdown of the game's pros and cons to help you decide if it's for you:

Pros:

Free-to-Play: Apex Legends is completely free to download and play, with optional cosmetic microtransactions.
Unique Legend Abilities: Choose from a growing roster of Legends, each with their own unique abilities that can influence the battlefield strategy.
Team-Oriented Gameplay: Work together with your two teammates to combine your abilities and strategize to win the match.
Fast-Paced Action: The movement system is fluid and the gunplay is satisfying, with a variety of weapons to choose from.
Regular Content Updates: The developers frequently add new Legends, weapons, maps, and gameplay modes to keep things fresh.
Cons:

Steep Learning Curve: Apex Legends can be difficult to master, especially for new players. The game requires good aim, map awareness, and teamwork.
Microtransactions: While the core gameplay is free, there are microtransactions for cosmetic items like character and weapon skins.
Can Be Frustrating: As with any battle royale game, there can be a lot of frustration when you die early.
Predatory Matchmaking: Some players complain that the matchmaking system can put you up against very skilled players, especially at lower levels.
Overall, Apex Legends is a great free-to-play hero shooter with a unique blend of strategy and action. If you're looking for a challenging and rewarding game to play with friends, then Apex Legends is definitely worth checking out.",True

12599,2024-03-16,325.5,"This is my FAVORITE game. I absolutely love it. It is a fast paced fps that has the best movement of any game I know. There are 25 unique (looking at you Mirage) legends that make it so no mater how you like to play, you can have fun. There are supports, recons, assault, skirmisher, and area control legends. There are at least 4 unique legends in each of those 5 categories, so no mater how you want to play, Apex has it. There are a lot of guns that all are useful for different circumstances (accept the charge rifle, that's worthless all round), so if you like sniping, you can take an smg and sniper. if you want to strafe fast use pistols, if you never want to reload, use lmg. there are guns no matter what sub play style you like.

the game itself is a pretty unstable game, any more than 100 ping and you feel it. It crashes every now and then, but not with any frequency. In the high ranks there are cheaters, because it is a hard game. It is not for everyone, you do 50 battles and only win once. Because of its difficulty it is a sweaty game. The movement is fluid, and can take some getting used to. I personaly am free to play, and everything in the store is expensive either way. APEX IS NOT A PAY TO WIN GAME. the only things you can buy are cosmetics. It has great graphics, but you will never go many games without a little lag.

over all, i love it. it is free to play, has everyone's playstyle, and has good graphics. moment is superb, high ranks have cheaters, but for the most part its good. oh and if you are solo q-ing, be prepared for toxic teammates. it is about a 1/4 randoms are toxic.",True

The first season of Apex Legends was bare bones.

In my opinion, The 3-D Respawn Entertainment's character select screen UI graphics is modern aesthetic inspired by American & Japanese fighting games of the early 90's + 00's. In addition, Apex Legends boasts a plentiful cast of phenomenal characters (legends), roster categorization system, and fun-relatable cast of people for players to choose from in-game, and even with Apex has evolved so much! (<1000+ enjoyed/played), the game is still a far ways (distance) away from a complete experience.

But with its incredibly steep learning curve...

Who is Apex Legends for?







A lot of multiplayer games are very dependent on the tone set by the community.
This digital congregation is a melting pot of casual players, hardcore enthusiasts, and eSports professionals, mirroring the game's versatility. However, as with any online game, the community's diversity means players might occasionally encounter less-than-ideal teammates or competitive spirits that don't align with their own. And as per usual, the loudest part of the community is the type of ""gamers"" who hate the game but keep playing it. The guys will yell at you through their Dollar Tree microphone for mistakes they've made. But hey, this happens in any type of competitive game out there.

The game introduces fresh mechanics to the battle royale genre, such as a detailed ping system for communication and a revival feature that keeps the hope of becoming the Apex Champion alive even after a squad member has fallen. These innovations - copied by other BR games - make it accessible to newcomers and offer depth to seasoned players. However, these same features that enrich the gameplay also steepen the learning curve, particularly for those not familiar with hero-based or team-centric games. If you are new to the game, just be prepared to hear things like
Apex isn't a fast-paced FPS which puts a lot of people off, even when they are very skilled at other shooters. Newbies will feel like they get downed in a split second while they on the other hand virtually shoot peas at their enemies. But once you take a step back, learn from your mistakes, and improve your decision-making, spatial awareness, positioning, movement, and game sense over time, you will notice how smooth the game can be.
And if for some reason you just don't enjoy the Battle Royale game mode, you can also play Control, Gun Game, and Team Death Match.

As a free-to-play title, Apex Legends is continuously evolving, with regular updates that introduce new Legends, maps, and gameplay mechanics. This keeps the game fresh but also means players need to stay on their toes to adapt to the changing landscape. What I like is that you basically only have to buy the Battle Pass once and if you level it up, you get enough Apex Coins (microtransaction currency) to buy the next one.
And of course, you have the typical loop of people loving or hating any change or addition being made. There is a trend in streamers and content creators not touching grass, just being in a bad mood, hating on the game, and lots of people in the community copy & paste their opinions. Just like when Shroud said, ""Valkery is the most stupid Champion ever because her HUD has a green tint when dropping in and he has zero visibility through it and he also can't tap strafe with her"".
There's also constructive feedback out there and the devs actually try and listen to it but they'll never manage to please everyone. I recommend not to engage with that toxic part of the community. Find your own reasons that motivate you to play the game.

Apex Legends feels like it's made by people who love classic games like Quake. While it may not satisfy the solitary gamer or those seeking visual spectacle in every corner, it stands as a testament to Respawn Entertainment's vision of what a free-to-play, team-based shooter can be. Getting better as a player, improving strategy, and communication converge to create exhilarating moments of triumph. Yes, there are some RNG aspects to Apex but that's the nature of all major Battle Royale games.
I recommend it if you are ready for a very steep learning curve and for Wraith players to rage quit;

i have played apex off and on since the game came out. While i do have a inner hatred for this game, this is by far the best and toughest battle royale to learn. You will have a hard time enjoying it for long without finding a decent team that understands and compliments your play style. I have received no compensation from ea for this comment even though i wish i had. lol",True

Extremely good gun Play.

Despite this I can't Support the publishing company being EA for the following reason:

You will easily get Banned for unknown reasons.
Even If you contact the Support directly to ask what you did wrong you will not get an answer what exactly you did wrong.

In my case IT was Inappropriate content (General)
This resulted in a 7 day Ban.
If you search online as to what the Rating of the Support at EA is xou are greeted with above 5000 Reviews and a avarage Score of 1/5 Stars.

On the contrary there are countless Video's / Streams / and Posts exposing the large amount of Hackers and Cheaters in this Game that are Not instantly Banned even reaching The highest Rank Apex Predator for multiple seasons in a row. You will meet them more offen f√ºr to dwindling Player Count even in lower Tiers (Gold - Diamond).

If you sink hours into the Game its very frustrating to come across such hipocrisy.

Luckily I have not spent money on the Game since it can be tanken away very quickly and without explanation.

For the reasons stated above maybe it is better to stay away from making this the main Game you play.

13088,2024-03-11,191.7,"Disappointed with the Current State of Apex Legends
As a long-time player of Apex Legends, I can't help but feel let down by the current state of the game. While it used to be a thrilling and enjoyable experience, it has now devolved into a frustrating mess of sweatiness and unbalanced matchmaking.

I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the greatest player out there, but I'd like to think that I'm at least competent. However, my recent experiences with the game have left me feeling utterly defeated. Every time I load it up, I'm greeted with a cycle of dropping in, dying almost immediately, and repeating the process ad nauseam. It's become increasingly difficult to even get a shot off, let alone secure a kill, when facing off against squads that seem to dominate the entire lobby effortlessly.

What's most disheartening is the apparent decline in the game's matchmaking system. Gone are the days when matches felt fair and evenly matched. Instead, I find myself pitted against opponents who vastly outmatch my skill level, making any hope of enjoyment quickly dissipate.

It pains me to see a game that I once cherished and spent countless hours playing now reduced to a shadow of its former self. While I have fond memories of Apex Legends from years past, the current state of the game leaves much to be desired. Unless significant improvements are made to address the issues of sweatiness and matchmaking imbalance, it's difficult to see myself returning to it with the same level of enthusiasm as before.",False

The game itself has made many improvements for Season 20. Right now the biggest complaint is the anti-cheat that feels nonexistent. I won't comment on the player base because I don't feel like that is anything to do with the game itself. The game hasn't always had the best changes to the game, but they do seem to listen to their community. Sometimes mostly to streamers and pro players instead of the majority of the player base, but they do seem to be trying. I will credit Respawn for that.

13359,2024-03-09,210.5,"Just a very inferior BR right now, especially with every new season. From the drop, it is heavy rng since you always seem to get a gun attachment or a shield cell while the squad that drops near you gets a flatline and a mastiff. After that, you have to deal with a couple unbalanced characters like Fuze, whose utility allows him to damage you greatly over time no matter where you use for cover. Little to no counter-play and is abused often.

With ranked, the devs can't decide whether to make it skill based or reward ratters for ranked points. They flip flop every season and cater to the pros that whine every year.

For gunplay, it's not necessarily bad, but it is certainly inferior to Warzone. Not to mention, there is a reason controllers are so heavily used in this game. MnK will always get outclassed against a controller due to poorly balanced aim assist. PC/Console crossplay for competitive multiplayer games was a mistake.

It's movement mechanics were really its only redeeming quality. I don't call champions with different abilities a pro because like all other games that do this mechanic (like Overwatch and Valorant), they don't really make a game better but can certainly make one worse due to poor balancing. Back to the movement mechanics, it feels more sluggish compared to when I played some time ago.

13600,2024-03-07,1394.8,"Gameplay-wise, this is the best battle royal game out there, still. It offers the most intense experience u can get out of fps (it's like DOOM on nightmare but against people). When Apex Legends got released, it was a brutal boom, everyone was playing it, every streamer. All the other BRs instantly copied the new mechanics they brought like pinging items and areas. The whole pinging system got added to almost every mainstream shooter, not just other battle royal games.

The down side is the insane skill gap between players and the que. Since the player base began to get smaller after the biggest boom.. balancing went to hell. It got way better since the last 2 seasons, but it's still ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.

The skill cap here is basically requiers you to have ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• tons of macros for moves that those ""movement gods"" abuse. Moves that you wouldn't be able to do with the normal controls. Some techniques are little things which when mastered, make you a god. So yeah, to get to the top u need to work insanely hard and u basically need to cheat. This is the game for crazy people who want as many options as possible and who want to play on the edge where every 0,5sec matters.

No othergame has such intense gameplay when you actually master it a bit. I have 1,2k hours atm. here and 500 hours on origins and i'm still a complete trash compared to people who play this seriously.¬®

This is one of those games where u end up on reddit/ytb looking for guides and tips bc as u get to like the game more, the same goes for frustration. Every time u feel like u are better than majority and that u actually got somewhere, u get instantly massacered by some sweaty dude who can move like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Rock Lee from Naruto and then u realize u'll never get anywhere.

This is why majority of players left and now it's just a game where they release BRUTALY over priced skins which are mostly just re-colors. There are almost no cross overs, they managed to make a deal with Final Fantasy franchise and released an insanely expensive heirloom sword lately, to get it u must have spent a fortune (100 euro and more). Skins are 40euro+ ussually if u want a good one, it's just a total nonsense. This is bc the game is dying (mobile version of this game died bc it didnt make enough money to make it worth fixing all the bugs so they just canceled it, NO REFUNDS) and apparently this is the only way to make it work.

I'm still giving this a yes bc i'm a casual and generaly i suck at it, but when u manage to win a game and u actually get decent number of kills, it's satisfying like no other game.",True

There have been ups and downs during the lifetime of Apex Legends, but it has always been a game that I have come back to. One of the main reasons is because of the diversity in character choices, skill types, and such. Oh and on top of that we get some pretty cool skins and upgrades as well. I honestly would recommend Apex Legends to anyone who wants to find their footing in the realm of fps games.

Yes.. you will lose, but I feel like the beauty of Apex Legends is the fact that there is room for everyone to grow and get better.

13639,2024-03-07,561.8,"Apex Legends, developed by Respawn Entertainment, has undoubtedly redefined the battle royale genre with its fast-paced action, strategic depth, and innovative gameplay mechanics. Set in the Titanfall universe, this free-to-play shooter pits teams of three players against each other in intense, squad-based combat, where skill, teamwork, and quick thinking are the keys to victory.

One of the standout features of Apex Legends is its diverse roster of Legends, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles. From the agile and elusive Wraith to the hulking and defensive Gibraltar, there's a Legend to suit every playstyle and strategy. The depth and variety offered by the Legends ensure that every match feels fresh and exciting, as players experiment with different team compositions and tactics.

The game's movement mechanics are another highlight, borrowing elements from Respawn's critically acclaimed Titanfall series. Running, sliding, and wall-running are all seamlessly integrated into the gameplay, allowing for fluid and dynamic movement across the map. Whether you're chasing down enemies or evading incoming fire, the movement mechanics in Apex Legends add a layer of skill and finesse that sets it apart from other battle royale games.

Combat in Apex Legends is fast-paced and satisfying, with a wide array of weapons and attachments to choose from. From assault rifles and shotguns to sniper rifles and grenade launchers, there's a weapon for every situation, and mastering the gunplay is essential for success in the game. The addition of unique hop-up attachments and weapon skins adds depth and customization to the experience, allowing players to personalize their loadouts and stand out on the battlefield.

The game's map design is also top-notch, with diverse environments ranging from sprawling urban areas to desolate wildernesses. Each location offers its own strategic advantages and challenges, encouraging players to adapt their tactics based on their surroundings. The addition of dynamic events such as supply drops and environmental hazards keeps matches unpredictable and ensures that no two games are ever the same.

While Apex Legends is undoubtedly one of the best battle royale games on the market, it's not without its flaws. Some players may find the learning curve to be steep, especially for newcomers to the genre, and the game's matchmaking system can occasionally lead to unbalanced matches. Additionally, while the game's cosmetic microtransactions are purely optional, some players may find the pricing to be a bit steep for certain items.

Overall, Apex Legends is a masterpiece of multiplayer gaming that sets a new standard for the battle royale genre. With its diverse roster of Legends, fluid movement mechanics, and exhilarating combat, it's a must-play for fans of competitive shooters and newcomers alike. So gather your squad, jump into the arena, and experience the thrill of Apex Legends for yourself.",True

First off, the gameplay in Apex is incredibly engaging. It's fast-paced, action-packed, and always keeps you on your toes. Every match feels like a new adventure, and the variety of characters, each with their own unique abilities, adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.

One of the things I love most about Apex is the teamwork aspect. You're always working with your squad to outsmart and outgun your opponents. Whether you're reviving a teammate, coordinating your ultimate abilities, or just communicating your next move, the teamwork required in Apex makes every victory feel even sweeter.

The graphics and design of the game are also top-notch. The maps are beautifully crafted, with diverse environments that keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. And the attention to detail in the character designs and animations really helps bring the world of Apex to life.

Another aspect of Apex that I appreciate is the constant updates and new content. The developers are always adding new features, weapons, and characters to keep the game feeling fresh and evolving.

Overall, Apex Legends is a fantastic game that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys fast-paced, team-based shooters. With its engaging gameplay, stunning graphics, and constant updates, it's definitely one of my favorite games to play.",True

13696,2024-03-07,2249.9,"Okay so I've been playing this game since it first released, it's... quite the experience if you're a solo q'r like me. if you have friends that can play with you and they know how to have a good time. This Battle royale can be very fun. However I will say this. solo q'ing ranked can be a very awful experience but if you can find yourself a good team that's been playing the game for a longtime it can be fun and competitive, it's designed to be that way.

Don't listen to other peoples reviews saying ""You have to make this game a second job in order to be good at it"" that's absolute BS. If you have the time practice in the firing range. The range is a fun experience on it's own because you get to learn movement mechanics, weapons and legend abilities. Take your time and you'll slowly excel at getting better but it takes time. Also practice in the mixtape gamemodes, that's why they're there. To help people practice with certain weapons and Legends. Once you learn everything it can be a fun experience. Try every legend you can. Trust me you'll find the legend that works for you but do NOT be stuck playing a legend for too long it can get boring. switch it up every once in a while it helps to keep the game fresh.

The only thing I'm iffy about on this game is that there isn't enough gamemode variety. They bring in a limited time mode about 3-4 times a season and most of the time they are very fun to play but they are there for a limited time which sucks but at the end of the day this game is designed to be a battle royale. If you find yourself liking a limited time mode too much and then uninstalling the game after it leaves. This isn't the game for you.

Quick tips to make your experience a little better. Stick very close to your teammates, they will appreciate this a lot. Do NOT push a team by yourself. 9 times out of 10 you will die. no matter how good you think you are at the game. There's no stopping 3 dudes shooting you at once unless you coordinate an attack with your team. And push EVO harvesters as soon as they spawn, this will get your armor more EVO points, and the more EVO harvesters you push, the more points you get, and the more points you get, the more upgrade perks you will unlock for your legend you're currently playing

If you've played nothing but fast TTK shooters like Call Of Duty. You need to change your mindset. This is not Call Of Duty. the TTK is longest I've seen it in any shooter. You need to unload an entire magazine to kill someone in late game. But like I said before the game is meant to be played this way. If you're willing to change and practice for this game. It will reward you. Then you'll come to find out that this is the best Battle royale currently on Steam.

I have at least 800+ hours counting the ones in Origin and played since the Beta. (Long life to OG KingsCanyon, RIP Skulltown) No game has been able to replicate the amount of satisfaction it gives to clutch a game or to win someone over your tier.

For sure the game has its bad things and patches, such as the Matchmaking problems and changes, but to stay fresh a competitive game needs to try multiple things people may or not like.

The game is fast paced, and, in their own way, every weapon seems usable. It does need a high playtime to git gud but for sure is refreshing when you play solo v trios and come out victorious. Plus the game has brought me a couple of good friendships so that's that.

Solid game and overall fun, just don't take it too serious, you will end up bald.",True

Or at most see 3 teams the total game, Or you're still on lvl 1 shield while the last team you meet is red shield. That is if you don't hot drop, if you do hot drop you have to be lucky enough to land on a weapon, ammo, anything that could help you survive the onslaught of punching from enemies that land with you. Even then you have to fight multiple teams just to run out of ammo and get third partied. You tell yourself that this game is the goat but that's only when you either get close to winning or winning after spending at most an 1hr of getting unlucky with drops, unlucky on hot drops, or the other person is just better. Once you win a game after spending a lot of time to just win once, you have to do it all over again just to be lucky enough to make it to be champion.

Now if you solo drop with randoms then you just gotta be lucky enough they're using sound, or even use their abilities. A lot of the time your randoms will just leave the game as soon as they get knocked, those who stay know that we need them because that is what makes a team, those who look out for each other and want to finish the game.",True

Well, I genuinely cannot think of a worse game for a new player to jump into. The game has been out for 5 years, and the skill ceiling has shot into space. It is way too hard to learn how to play the game, since it is not only a difficult game to do well in, but the matchmaking also sucks and you're going to get dominated by an extremely sweaty player nearly every match.

I would consider myself to be a slightly above average player. Ive played the game since launch with a few long breaks here and there. I love the game, but it is an absolutely MISERABLE experience without friends. One good match is just not worth the torrent of bad matches ended by the same top 1,000 players using the same legends with the same guns with the same insane movement. It is completely impossible to enjoy this game casually.

All that aside, the game has abysmal monetization (20$-200$ skins), 20hz servers (the standard is 60), overpowered aim assist on controllers, a cheater infestation, and a slew of bugs every update.

Making a new EA account is a cumbersome process, in my case specifically i had to download a vpn to create an account, when you go to select your region mine was locked in south korea which is not where i am and i tried to change it to my country and it would not allow me to change it. the issue with south korea is that it requires a korea phone number so i couldn't even lie if i wanted to. so after i downloaded a vpn i was able to set up my account using an email address, as you would expect, and it worked i made an account and was ready to play. I opened the game and clicked on the sign in option and my steam just gives me an error and tells me to reset my password even though i never entered a password or email address or username. i don't really know who to blame for this or maybe im doing something wrong but i just feel like when you put a game on steam you should allow steam to manage the account side of things, you shouldnt have to make a seperate account and then make the process for said account a terrible one. i just want to play games and have fun but nowadays that seems less and less plausible. giant companies don't care if youre having fun anymore they don't care about your time playing the game they just want money and its sad. i wish gaming was still fun, and don't get me wrong some companies are doing it right and they do care but i remember a time when almost all of the video game producers cared, games were fun, the focus was on the player rather than the investors and making money. I understand that the point of a business is to make money but both parties can be happy, create good quality games and the money will flow in quickly. like i said before im sure this game is great so if you want to play it play it but these are my thoughts on everything.",True

They deliver updates very slowly some PATCHES taking months to come and also make it difficult to earn XP some quests even taking specific characters to complete. Characters in which new players don't have, so they have 2 options spend money or play the game modes that are either forgotten about for months or just used to much. They have been running out of Ideas to the point they don't even introduce new legends or guns. They ignore the community so much that things that have been asked for come YEARS later. They should have quit updating the game and added every mode made (Besides the holiday specials) to a rotation and added the holiday modes when that holiday is happening and worked on newer projects like I don't maybe TITANFALL 3 that they have been teasing us with at this point.

Climbing the ranks in Apex Legends requires a combination of skill, strategy, and persistence. Here are some tips to help you ascend to the Predator rank:

Understand the Ranking System: Know how the point system works for your specific rank. Kills, assists, and placement contribute to your points in a match. Familiarize yourself with the point deductions for starting a match in your rank to strategize effectively.

Master a Few Legends: Become highly skilled with a few characters to adapt to different team compositions and strategies. Knowing the ins and outs of your chosen legends‚Äô abilities can be the difference in critical moments.

Improve Game Mechanics: Work on your shooting accuracy, movement, and positioning. Apex Legends is fast-paced, so being able to move and shoot effectively is crucial. Utilize the training area to practice.

Teamwork and Communication: Apex is a team game. Communicate with your squad, whether it's through pings or voice chat. Sharing enemy locations, coordinating attacks, or calling out resources can significantly increase your chances of winning.

Strategic Play: Sometimes, engaging in every fight isn‚Äôt the best strategy. Know when to fight and when to avoid conflict to survive longer and secure higher placements in matches.

Analyze and Learn: After each game, take a moment to reflect on what went well and what could be improved. Watch replays or streams of higher-ranked players to learn different tactics and strategies.

Stay Consistent: Progress in ranking up is about consistency. Play regularly and try to maintain a steady performance. Avoid tilt by taking breaks if you're on a losing streak.

Squad Up: Whenever possible, play with friends or players you synergize well with. A coordinated team has a better chance of outplaying random squads, especially in higher ranks.

By focusing on these areas, you‚Äôll improve your gameplay and increase your chances of climbing the ranks in Apex Legends. Remember, progress takes time, so be patient and enjoy the journey.",True

14199,2024-03-03,7.4,"With a combined playtime rivaling my cat's nap schedule, Apex Legends has become my digital playground of choice. But let's talk about the real stars of the show: the female legends. They're not just badass fighters; they're total stunners. From Wraith's mysterious allure to Lifeline's stylish flair, these ladies are as deadly as they are easy on the eyes.

And the gameplay? It's like a choreographed dance of destruction. Sliding, jumping, ziplining‚Äîit's a symphony of movement that keeps me on the edge of my seat. And don't even get me started on the ping system. It's like having a psychic connection with my squadmates, only cuter.

Visually, Apex Legends is a treat. The vibrant environments and detailed character designs make every match feel like a work of art. Sure, there are a few bugs here and there, but when you're fighting alongside a squad of fierce females, who cares? In conclusion, Apex Legends is a battle royale masterpiece that's as easy on the eyes as it is thrilling to play. So grab your squad, channel your inner goddess, and let's dominate the battlefield together.",True

14249,2024-03-03,148.2,"This game has unparalleled gunplay, movement, and legends. It's a pioneer in its space, and has extremely skilled players. It's also ridiculously grindy, extremely overpriced, and feels like a chore to play. I haven't been playing on steam long but I have around 2000 hours across the platforms. Most decisions the developers make alienate the playerbase in the interest of profits, there is hardly any communication between them and the players, and it shows. Entire events full of recolored skins for their full price ($20 a piece!!), overpriced cosmetics, the worst ranked system of any game I've played, and a community with a toxically ""git gud"" mentality, striving for wins above all else because they're so few and far between for most players. Only the top players seem to have a good experience, as the matchmaking is heavily catered to the people who play 8-10 hours a day. Lobbies are filled with players better than you, to the point where you can't compete and thus can't improve without devoting massive amounts of time, energy and effort. I feel this game has been circling the drain since arenas was removed and it's very disheartening. It could've been great if it had a little more attention to gameplay than to profit.

14377,2024-03-02,82.1,"Apex Legends isn't just another battle royale game; it's a masterful blend of heart-pounding action, strategic gameplay, and compelling storytelling that sets it apart from the competition.

From the moment you drop into the vibrant and meticulously crafted world of Apex Legends, you're greeted with an adrenaline-fueled experience like no other. The first thing that strikes you is the diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique abilities and personalities. Whether you're a seasoned player or a newcomer to the genre, there's a Legend that suits your playstyle, offering a sense of inclusivity and diversity that is truly refreshing.

What truly sets Apex Legends apart, however, is its emphasis on teamwork and collaboration. Unlike other battle royale games where solo play dominates, Apex Legends encourages communication and coordination among teammates. The game's innovative ping system allows players to effectively communicate with their squadmates, even without uttering a single word. Whether you're marking enemy positions, suggesting loot locations, or simply expressing gratitude for a well-executed play, the ping system fosters a sense of camaraderie that is unparalleled in the genre.

But it's not just about teamwork; Apex Legends delivers in terms of gameplay mechanics as well. The gunplay is smooth and satisfying, with a wide array of weapons and attachments to suit every playstyle. Whether you prefer close-quarters combat with shotguns and SMGs or long-range engagements with sniper rifles, Apex Legends offers a diverse arsenal that keeps each match feeling fresh and exciting.

Moreover, the game's map design is nothing short of spectacular. From the sprawling landscapes of Kings Canyon to the futuristic cityscapes of Olympus, each map is intricately designed to encourage dynamic gameplay and strategic decision-making. Whether you're navigating treacherous terrain or engaging in intense firefights in urban environments, every match presents new challenges and opportunities for exploration.

Beyond its addictive gameplay, Apex Legends also excels in its storytelling and world-building. Through a series of cinematic trailers, in-game events, and character interactions, Respawn Entertainment has crafted a rich and immersive universe filled with lore and intrigue. From the enigmatic motivations of the mysterious Syndicate to the personal histories of each Legend, there's always something new to discover in the world of Apex Legends.

In conclusion, Apex Legends stands as a testament to the power of innovation and creativity in the gaming industry. With its dynamic gameplay, emphasis on teamwork, and rich storytelling, it's no wonder that millions of players around the world have been captivated by its charm. Whether you're a casual gamer looking for a thrilling experience or a competitive player seeking the ultimate challenge, Apex Legends offers something for everyone. Strap in, drop down, and prepare for the fight of your life ‚Äì the Apex Games await.",True

14485,2024-03-01,104.2,"Honestly this game has had a lot of issues. If you want to enjoy a game where players do nothing but camp and steal glory for the win then this is definitely the game for you. Furthermore, the lag of the servers are way passed playable where you will be punching the enemy one second and by the time you are about to down them you will randomly go down due to the lag. The lobbies are full of hackers as well and nothing is being done nothing to fix this issue. The champions and guns are not balanced at all, no matter how you train with them you will always need luck on your side in order to hit anyone. If you have loss packets then good luck your accuracy will mean nothing as the bullets will not count the damage when you hit an enemy. As the the Champions nothing is being done to make them fair enough in a 1v1 situation certain Champs will always win in a fight so the lobbies will be full of the players doing nothing but spamming the broken abilities. Lastly the guns that you get when you drop will not have its bullets next to is 60% of the time so good luck in trying to win a fight where you have empty guns to shoot. So before you want to invest your money into this game just know that this is what you will face, which honestly is not worth your hard earned money. So do not download and play this game.",False

14555,2024-02-29,1723.1,"Don't bother if you are going to be on mnk, i have thousands of hours on this game on mnk, no matter how much I practice my aim for YEARS, I get one clipped by a roller. I have played on MNK for idk since I was 11 and now I am 27... I switched to roller for the first time ever (well since the first xbox came out and stopped roller when xbox 360 came out) about two weeks ago and have been getting 10+ kills per match (not joking) vs my usual 2-3 on mnk because I can actually let aimbot do the work for me aka controller aim assist. People want to say i isn't broken... yeah I cannot achieve the same skill to this day on mnk. Sure mnk has a higher skill ceiling but majority of us in fights lets face it, we don't use neo-strafing unless we are octane which even then most fights are up close where controller has the upprehand. Mid and long range sure mnk has a slight advantage due to recoil control... to counter it you need a 3x or 2-4x or 6x for sniper and aimbot does the control. Vs on mnk you can hit people at a distance a bit easier even with a 1x.

All in all, use a roller if ur not looking to try to get flashy with movement, oh did i mention the roller guy just has to back up a little and he will be able to kill you in your neo strafe? Lets not forget how hard it is to shoot a neo strafer in general, if your aim is already bad on mnk, you will miss like a roller player (but you would miss more because you dont have the micro adjustments from aimbot)",False

That being said, no i would not recommend to other players because other players are cheating, macro using, toggle flipping, bug exploiting, zone camping, discord teaming, lag switching, wall hacking, aim botting, braindead losers.
